as far as I know we still haven’t fixed having too many validators / sure maxeb could help, but maybe the protocol could also introduce a max validator count.

Not not a problem?
00:37:44	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "Just to mention, if ..."

The point made in the EIP is that the equilibrium level is not materially changed by changing the churn, merely the guarantees on fastest possible growth.

The validator set size is down from 1.1M to 1M

00:51:45	Luca | Vero:	Have you talked to say, the top 20 largest staking node operators and asked why they haven’t migrated yet?

Based on this I was under the impression they could have higher APR - https://www.attestant.io/posts/exploring-validator-compounding/

i think the math works out but i’m just not sure how much professional operators are factoring it into their decisions above engineering costs of switching. not sure this is impactful enough to effect real changes in adoption and i think the overall appetite for maxeb changes will be low and as we tweak more, so should consider very impactful changes
00:53:20	Ansgar Dietrichs:	we historically have failed to properly prioritize features if they didn’t need a hard fork EIP.

If you earn more rewards for a 0x01 than a 0x02, we can make it very comfy to switch and many will still decide to not switch. A 0x02 at 2048 is neutral but all balances below that see a lower yield . So a 0x02 at 34 ETH for example earn 2.3% less in yield than a  0x01 and also doesn’t get free withdrawals. This is an issue.

I think there have been delays in implementation in the overall chain, e.g. it's not just the staking operators that have to implement, but partners on custodian sides etc.

Or actually, as the hysteresis operates right now, they can never just stop compounding at some point and have the same yield as 0x01. But as mentioned in the EIP, they can game the hysteresis by withdrawing down to a balance of 32.75 ETH (or 33.75 ETH, etc)

I need a bit of time to read and understand your proposed changes, Anders, but I think the real point here is: we should talk to the largest staking providers to find out why they haven’t consolidated yet.

It may not be a question of incentives and therefore making any further incentive changes might be a waste of time if the goal is more consolidations.

@Luca | Vero We can from a first-principle approach assume that someone wants a higher yield on their capital, ceteris paribus. (Regardless what they say about it)

I don’t mind involving SSPs in the conversation however of course. But this EIP is focused quite a bit on home stakers that would stake say 64 or 128. They suffer the most from the current EB calculation.

01:08:57	Toni Wahrstätter:	FOCIL is clearly on the roadmap and people agree on its importance but we shouldn't put it on top of ePBS. Both EIPs are complex by themselves and ePBS itself will be a big-enough feature already.
FOCIL in H*. Won't be more difficult.
01:09:14	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I am worried about FOCIL impact on Glamsterdam timelines, but the argument that there is a risk censorship resistance will become more controversial over time is also valid. hard tradeoff to make.

Well, the large SSPs are going to have the largest impact numbers-wise, that’s why I suggested talking to them and understanding what their current blockers are.

I see no issue with that 👍 Still we should make sure that a home staker at 40 ETH can use a compounding 0x02 without getting 2.3% lower yields than an SSP. 8068 addresses this, and a number of other things
01:12:53	Toni Wahrstätter:	There's 1 person that understand both + their interaction. If we're generous, then it's a handful of people. There will be unknown unknowns, just by the nature of being big interacting features.
01:13:07	Francesco:	Replying to "is this something th..."

Well tbh I’d care much less about that vs a staker with 500 ETH. It’s not a huge deal if the few 1000s of home stakers stay with 0x01

Ok. Well if you’re at 500 ETH your hit isn’t that big. Still you’ll be earning slightly less than at 32. And we also have the “32.75 ETH gaming hysteresis” that I think we should address.
