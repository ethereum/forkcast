00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.380
Łukasz Rozmej: The pre-call.

2
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.320
stokes: Hello!

3
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.819
stokes: Can people hear me okay?

4
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.750
Josh Davis: Yep, unclear.

5
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.520
stokes: Okay, cool.

6
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.820
stokes: Okay, yeah, sorry, I had to grab some other headphones.

7
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:57.499
stokes: Let's see, we have, I think, enough people to get started. So yeah, Josh, if you're helping with the stream, I'm ready when you are.

8
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.290
Josh Davis: Alright, you are alive.

9
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:10.000
stokes: Okay, thanks, everyone. Welcome to ACDC number 168.

10
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:15.890
stokes: This is issue 1772 in the PM repo.

11
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.040
stokes: And…

12
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:29.069
stokes: Yeah, should have a pretty exciting call today. We'll review what's happened on the Vusaka side of things, with an eye towards officially confirming our mainnet dates.

13
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:38.589
stokes: And then we can transition into Glamsterdam and discuss a number of EIPs there to continue scoping that fork.

14
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.179
stokes: So… Let's go ahead and get into it.

15
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:55.209
stokes: First up, I believe, you know, some major events since our last call, would have been Sepolia going to BP02, and then Fusaka happening on Hoodie.

16
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:04.719
stokes: I see Perry's here. Maybe he can give us some updates on what he's seen? Also Barnabas. Yeah, okay, thanks.

17
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:14.549
Parithosh Jayanthi: So, for, Superior BPO2, it went smoothly. We haven't necessarily seen any, issues. Also.

18
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:27.009
Parithosh Jayanthi: We are looking at all of our data being collected, and there's a huge bias towards SuperNodes and Sepolia, which makes sense, considering every validator's probably a super node, and everyone providing RPC is a supernode.

19
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.320
Parithosh Jayanthi: The hoodie data is a bit more interesting. We do have a better distribution of,

20
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:45.500
Parithosh Jayanthi: custody columns on Hoodie. The fork on Hoodie itself also went perfectly fine. There was a small drop in participation, most of it attributed to,

21
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:57.490
Parithosh Jayanthi: operator issues. However, there was this one lead bug that was found, and I let the lead team expand on that a bit later. But in the meantime, we've… they've already patched the…

22
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.310
Parithosh Jayanthi: festivalista.

23
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:12.030
stokes: Okay, great. And I guess, yeah, zooming into the REST bug a minute, it sounds like it was a combination of some edge cases.

24
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.510
stokes: I guess it'd be good to also…

25
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.049
stokes: Yeah, at least explore if we could have a static test for this. I'm not sure if that was…

26
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.309
stokes: If it's really something that's, well addressed by that format of test.

27
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:37.530
Parithosh Jayanthi: So, we had tested this scenario in the past, but the outcome is basically an orphan block, and I guess we didn't necessarily miss… we missed this,

28
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:51.870
Parithosh Jayanthi: In that scenario. So we're talking to the testing team, and I think we will have a explicit test for this. There were just some details that they were figuring out, and I see PK's on the call. He was the one who figured out the sequence of events, so maybe…

29
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.400
Parithosh Jayanthi: You want to speak, PK?

30
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.960
pk910: Nothing really to add there, yeah.

31
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:09.270
stokes: Okay. That works then. Cool, okay, well, nice find. And yeah, it seems like they already have it patched, so…

32
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:16.870
stokes: That's good. Okay, otherwise, yeah, it looks like things have been going pretty well.

33
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:22.019
stokes: Anything else on the forks?

34
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.629
stokes: Or more generally on Fusaka.

35
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.340
stokes: If not, I think we can go ahead and discuss mainnet dates.

36
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.330
stokes: So… excuse me.

37
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:46.370
stokes: So, yeah, on the last ACDC, I wanted to start this ball rolling, just so that, yeah, we could basically move ahead today.

38
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:54.100
stokes: Because the proposal would be following, this original dark, doc from Barnabas that… here, I'll grab this link…

39
00:13:54.410 --> 00:14:07.080
stokes: But ultimately, would say mainnet releases out, November 3rd, which is, I believe, Monday, and then we'd have the fork one month from then, so that would be December 3rd, for Foostock on Mainnet.

40
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:15.610
stokes: Along with that, there's dates for the BP01 on Maynet, that would be on December 9th.

41
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.470
stokes: And BPO2, that would be January 7th of next year.

42
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.120
stokes: So…

43
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:32.130
stokes: Again, last ACDC, people were generally on board. Didn't seem like there were being issues with that. We checked again on ACDE last week. People are okay with that.

44
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:42.300
stokes: Following the process doc that we have, you know, we really… if we're following the letter of it, we should wait until today to actually officially set the dates.

45
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.969
stokes: So, I'd suggest we do that now.

46
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:54.649
stokes: And… yeah, again, I think everyone is on board at this point, so… any reason not to do it? Otherwise, we'll lock that in and kick off

47
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.070
stokes: Everything we need to do there.

48
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.670
stokes: Anya?

49
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.980
Manu: Yeah, hi. So the rings are…

50
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:13.730
Manu: who did fork, so some user reported some bugs we, for some reason, didn't see on Holesky, or Sepolia, or testnets, or DevNets.

51
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.770
Manu: Rough.

52
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.840
Manu: Some of them are, fixed, or…

53
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:25.269
Manu: Are going to be fixed, and for at least one bug, we don't have the root cause yet.

54
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:31.149
Manu: For example, this bug is, yes, is, after a few hours.

55
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.320
Manu: Prism Nodes tends to… kick out.

56
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.580
Manu: non-present peers, and so after a few hours, the prism has only prism pairs.

57
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:46.980
Manu: We don't have a fix yet, and for that reason, it's very likely we cannot…

58
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.880
Manu: release on, next Monday.

59
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.270
stokes: Okay Hmm.

60
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:07.890
stokes: Okay, maybe we'll circle back to that. Is everyone else okay with, these dates?

61
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:17.619
Manu: I'm not saying we should, we should delay the mainnet, but I'm just saying that it's unlikely we release on Monday.

62
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.460
stokes: Yeah.

63
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.899
stokes: Yeah, which is maybe okay.

64
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:28.769
stokes: Like, especially if we get something, you know, at some point next week, I think that still is enough time for people.

65
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:39.470
stokes: Okay. Would you be okay, then, if we went ahead with these dates, that we have as is, and…

66
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.990
stokes: Yeah, I mean, worst case then, like, something…

67
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:52.420
stokes: Would become a deeper issue than we expect, and then we would need to adjust, which we could do.

68
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.229
stokes: There just might be some thrash with everyone else trying to get ready.

69
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:19.199
Manu: And so, yeah, iPhone is asking if I can say why it is only surfacing now. I cannot at the moment. We didn't see this issue on, you know, DevNet or, say, Polya and Holesky. We are still investigating.

70
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.070
stokes: Yeah, sounds like it'd only really become apparent on a hoodie.

71
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:35.960
stokes: Which is, you know, interesting. I think Hoodie has a much more realistic, node distribution than the other testnuts, so…

72
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.760
stokes: Okay.

73
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:51.960
stokes: I think if you're okay with it, that's what I would say, is just go ahead and move ahead with this, and yeah, we'll just keep an eye on it. If we need to adjust, then we can adjust.

74
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:04.450
Manu: Yeah, I agree with Justin about keeping mandate dates and delay release from prison.

75
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.420
stokes: Copp.

76
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:17.220
stokes: Okay, then in that case, let's see… I think, let's see, Nimbus…

77
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.200
stokes: I'm not sure if anyone from Nimbus is here.

78
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.200
stokes: Or Grand Dean, if they're around.

79
00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:48.449
stokes: Okay, well, as far as I know, they wouldn't have any issues with this. So, let's go ahead and do that.

80
00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:54.059
stokes: And… yeah, Prism team, we'll just wait for your release as soon as we can get it.

81
00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:02.750
stokes: Otherwise, yeah, let's go ahead and do this. There's a number of other places, the Meta EIP, there's this process doc for Fusaka.

82
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.230
stokes: That will have all this information.

83
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.730
stokes: And, yeah, one more note on that,

84
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:25.200
stokes: you know, we set up the structure, with Pectra, and just wanting a little more clarity around, you know, if there is an incident, how would you respond to it. So I will be reaching out to everyone to, essentially get a point person per team, so that will go in the PR.

85
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.019
stokes: And… then we should be good there.

86
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.600
stokes: And otherwise…

87
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:39.410
stokes: yeah, I think we're good to go. So, again, I know everyone, this was, a big lift to get this together by this point in time, so thank you for that.

88
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.999
stokes: This is a really cool fork.

89
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:49.239
stokes: the people I've talked to in the community are very excited about it, and yeah, it's a really big deal, so…

90
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.880
stokes: Super exciting.

91
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:57.369
stokes: And yeah, let's just then focus this next month on getting a safe upgrade to Mainnet.

92
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.810
stokes: Cool.

93
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.330
stokes: Okay, thanks everyone for the updates there.

94
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.280
stokes: I did want to circle back to this one last thing for Fusaka.

95
00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:26.270
stokes: Barnabas had a suggestion to this process doc I was just referring to, and, essentially, okay, so the language we have today is that mainnet should not have an upgrade date set until all testnets have been upgraded, that's what we've been doing.

96
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:35.010
stokes: He essentially proposes to change the language such that, we only need at least one testnet, and

97
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.209
stokes: There's some discussion on the PR if you want to check this out.

98
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.850
stokes: I think the feedback is a bit mixed, and I kind of tend to agree, like.

99
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:52.510
stokes: I hear what Barnabas is trying to do, just to give us some more flexibility around setting the date versus having to go through all of these testnets.

100
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.220
stokes: Again, of course, you know, I think the…

101
00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:04.090
stokes: Ambient context here to keep in mind is, like, obviously, if there's an issue, we, like, would not just blindly move ahead with mainnet.

102
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:12.540
stokes: Yeah, so, in any case, I don't know if anyone wants to say anything else about this, at the moment.

103
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:19.460
stokes: But also, yeah, I… I'm not sure we want to merge this as is. Ben?

104
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.390
Ben Adams: Isn't a more important thing not the…

105
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.319
Ben Adams: Waiting for the testnet to set a date, but…

106
00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:35.849
Ben Adams: The distance from the testnet going live to when the mainnet date is.

107
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.160
Ben Adams: If you say to me.

108
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.659
Ben Adams: That period between the two, rather than…

109
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.989
Ben Adams: When we decide on the date.

110
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:53.049
stokes: Mmm… Perhaps. So, I mean, the thing we definitely want is one month between the date and Maynet.

111
00:21:53.670 --> 00:22:00.890
stokes: And… I believe the intent here is just to have the ability to…

112
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:06.129
stokes: You know, essentially all agree on what the date would be, even if the testnets haven't forked.

113
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:13.060
stokes: That way we can move things forward, kind of like we were trying to do this time, where, you know,

114
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:19.610
stokes: Especially given the timing here, where, like, presumably we'd have releases out on Monday, or, again, sometime next week.

115
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:29.319
stokes: I, you know, I wouldn't want to come and propose this, for example, on this call, being like, hey everyone, by the way, like, get a release out in a few days, over the weekend.

116
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:37.449
stokes: So that's, you know, that's where we're trying to find the balance of the language here, just to give us the flexibility to avoid, you know, very short turnarounds.

117
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.500
stokes: But yeah, so…

118
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:50.830
stokes: I think in that case, we'll just let this simmer a bit more. If I find a minute, maybe I'll try to think of some…

119
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.480
stokes: Yeah, better language that captures more precisely what we want.

120
00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.850
stokes: Okay.

121
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.380
stokes: Anything else on Fishaka for the moment?

122
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.150
stokes: Okay.

123
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:30.429
stokes: Then, Glacier Dam. This should be exciting, we can talk about scoping, and, you know, one reason it will be exciting is there are a large number of VIPs. Actually, let me just try to grab the MetaVIP link.

124
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.030
stokes: If people want to follow along that way.

125
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:38.590
stokes: So, there are a large number of PFI'd EIPs.

126
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.990
stokes: And the good news, for today is most of them are…

127
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:50.570
stokes: entirely on the EL side, which makes our job a little bit easier on the CL side.

128
00:23:51.040 --> 00:24:03.909
stokes: And I tried to keep track, like, keep up with everything. We had the deadline today, so there were a lot of things. I think there's even a few more that are still in PRs, which, you know, just to be clear, I think that's fine.

129
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.530
stokes: We can get those merged, you know, today, tomorrow, and I think those can still be in bounds.

130
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:15.330
stokes: There's, yeah, a few things we need to do on the EIP editing side, just to actually get them in.

131
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.329
stokes: But, in any case,

132
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.500
stokes: Yeah, so there's a number here of,

133
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.130
stokes: EIPs on the agenda that we can cover today.

134
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:36.119
stokes: And… Yeah, I think we're pretty much ready to get into it. I guess one more comment here.

135
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:42.120
stokes: is, in terms of process, I think today, you know, we can just maybe touch on each one.

136
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.730
stokes: And…

137
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:51.670
stokes: If people are here and want to say a few words, that's great. If there's, like, other considerations we want to get into, you know, we can start that process.

138
00:24:52.400 --> 00:25:02.029
stokes: I… you know, given the timings here and the deadline being today, I'm not expecting people to, you know, like, we don't even necessarily have the full set until now, so…

139
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.680
stokes: We can't really make decisions today, and…

140
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:20.780
stokes: Then what I would propose is, each client team, again, have a written proposal, kind of like we've done in the past, with their view of what should go in on the CL side, and have that by the next ACDC. So that would be two weeks from today, that's 13th November.

141
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:28.369
stokes: And that should be… Hopefully a nice way to move forward, yeah, I'm expecting…

142
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.069
stokes: Well, at least I'm hoping there's pretty,

143
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.500
stokes: Pretty default, rough consensus, just, once everyone takes a look, and we move forward.

144
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.960
stokes: So…

145
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:47.020
stokes: I guess one question then for everyone here, does that sound okay timing-wise? Having something together in the next two weeks?

146
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:53.529
stokes: And then we can take that input on the next ACDC and move forward there.

147
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.090
stokes: And, yeah, I'm hoping it should be a pretty smooth process on the CL side.

148
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.559
stokes: Okay, yeah, I got a few thumbs up here.

149
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.570
stokes: As we went. So, okay, so let's do that.

150
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.829
stokes: And then… let's get into it. So…

151
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.800
stokes: I'm just checking to make sure there aren't other comments here.

152
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.509
stokes: I think I got them all, so…

153
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:32.940
stokes: Yeah, I went down the list yesterday and just tried to pull out the CL ones. Also, yeah, if there's one I missed, please call it out. That was just an omission on my part, because, again, there's a very long list to go through.

154
00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:40.289
stokes: But I tried to pull out the things that have any seal bearing, so either are entirely in the seal layer,

155
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:47.260
stokes: Which I think they bifurcate pretty well. Maybe fossil is the one cross-layer thing that we still have to discuss.

156
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:59.139
stokes: But yeah, so let's go. The first one would be 7688. This should be the SSZ EAP that introduces stable containers.

157
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:11.629
stokes: We'd had, Pureeth as, like, this bigger bundle of features for, like, clients and, you know, different things in that domain that, I believe was proposed as the headliner, but was not selected.

158
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:19.310
stokes: eTong came back and picked out a smaller subset to propose as a PFI EIP. So, we have this one.

159
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:26.309
stokes: I don't know if Etan's on the call, or if anyone wants to speak to 7688.

160
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.579
stokes: But this would be a good chance to do so.

161
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.230
stokes: Okay.

162
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:46.720
stokes: Okay, and yeah, Justin's just calling out here. There is a specs PR on the seal side.

163
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.170
stokes: Pr4630, link here in the chat if you want to take a look. So…

164
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.250
stokes: Yeah, I think that's probably it for that today.

165
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:03.460
stokes: But keep it in mind, this should be something that we reason about for, the scoping over the next two weeks.

166
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.160
stokes: Okay.

167
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:16.900
stokes: Next up, 8045. So, this EIP, essentially changes the way the proposal shuffling works, so that we exclude slash validators.

168
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:28.589
stokes: Today, if you look at the specs, when you go to derive the proposer shuffling at a given point in time, it selects from the entire set of validators, and that could include slash validators.

169
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:35.819
stokes: At the same time, we have a rule that slash validators cannot propose, and so this basically is a de facto missed slot.

170
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:43.520
stokes: And, you know, I think usually this isn't really an issue, because there just aren't that many slash validators, especially on mainnet, at a given point in time.

171
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:56.360
stokes: This did, I believe, become more apparent on Halushki, for example, because there were many more slash validators there, and then what happens is, you know, the chain quality or, like, liveness kind of degrades, which is not nice, so…

172
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:05.949
stokes: 8045, just has a small change to how the permitting shuffling works, to exclude slash validators. Pretty straightforward.

173
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:10.760
stokes: I actually forget who… Barnabas, were you actually the author on this one?

174
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.740
stokes: I feel like I remember that.

175
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.930
Barnabas: I'm a co-author.

176
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.200
stokes: Okay.

177
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.999
stokes: Well, do you or another co-author want to say anything?

178
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.890
stokes: That's not just the overall.

179
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.939
Francesco: Yeah, I mean, I think…

180
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:40.190
Francesco: it's pretty simply IP, you think you said pretty much everything. Yeah, the motivation came from Barnabas, which I think you pretty much already covered, and…

181
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.250
Francesco: Yeah, I think, basically.

182
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:59.149
Francesco: It's just something that used to work this way because, we didn't have proposed look ahead, and it would have caused problems to school slash validators. Now it doesn't. It's not a huge deal, like, it's, you know, it's clearly not the most important EIP, but it's also extremely simple.

183
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.979
Francesco: So maybe we might as well do it.

184
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.820
stokes: Okay, thanks.

185
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.149
stokes: So, take a look at that one, again.

186
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:16.199
stokes: This is, you know, famous last words, but I think it's… Essentially, literally a one-line change.

187
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.820
stokes: So, pretty, pretty straightforward.

188
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:20.540
stokes: Okay.

189
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:30.079
stokes: Next up, we have 8061. This is an EIP that's, a little more involved than the last one, but not too much more.

190
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.109
stokes: And it proposes to increase the churn limits.

191
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:38.809
stokes: So, yeah, this one, we'll probably want to sit and think about a bit,

192
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:47.409
stokes: So these turn limits have to do with entries and exits to the validator set. I think it also touches consolidations, right, Francesca?

193
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:55.580
Francesco: Yeah, there's, like, kind of two separate churn limits, for consolidations and for the rest.

194
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.069
stokes: Okay, and so all of them would be increased with the CIP?

195
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:14.319
Francesco: Yes. I mean, these are just… well, the numbers in the IP are… well, like, the IP is proposing to increase all of them. In principle, we could increase only the exits and entries, or only the consolidations, or anyway, do some… some… something, yeah, a combination of these things.

196
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:22.389
Francesco: But, like, I would propose to increase all of them, because I think there's reasons why we care about pretty much all of these numbers, and yeah.

197
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.739
stokes: Okay, cool. So yeah, so… It increases, all these trim limits.

198
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:43.439
stokes: And, you know, for anyone listening who might not be that familiar, what this would mean practically is, yeah, it's faster for you to get into the sets, to exit the set, also to consolidate. Which sounds good, you know, I think that's a pretty strict UX win in a vacuum.

199
00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:51.169
stokes: Of course, there are always trade-offs, and what do we lose? Well, this would eat in 2 weeks of rotivity, that we have today, so…

200
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.379
stokes: Again, I think this is a pretty straightforward change.

201
00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:02.719
stokes: In terms of the specs, but there are implications here for, yeah, essentially the security here with the switchability parameter, so…

202
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.769
stokes: Something to take a look at, again, over the two weeks, and think a bit about.

203
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:15.139
stokes: Actually, yeah, Francesca, do you have a sense, I think, from what I remember…

204
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:21.240
stokes: was it having the wheat? Like, basically, would it, like, double churn and then half-week subjectivity, or is it…

205
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:29.540
Francesco: So it's, yeah, it's slightly more complicated, just because there's these two churns, and, with the numbers I put, which, again, are, like, preliminary,

206
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:40.690
Francesco: they're basically just some numbers that make the weak subjectivity period be around a week. And, yeah, with these numbers, you get something that's around a week, and the actual increases, like, in the assurance is.

207
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:50.269
Francesco: 4X for exits and activations, and 2X for consolidations. So it basically goes from, like, around 15 days to around a week, or, like, to be precise, 6 days.

208
00:32:50.270 --> 00:33:01.769
Francesco: Which, to me, seems, like, quite reasonable. But yeah, of course, we can, like… I don't know, if we find, like, a number for the weak subject… subjectivity period that people

209
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:13.790
Francesco: think makes sense, then we can sort of work back from there and figure out what the numbers can be from this perspective, in terms of the churns. And then, yeah, of course, there's these other considerations that people are mentioning in the chat.

210
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:22.930
Francesco: But, like, purely from, like, a weak subjectivity perspective, it's really easy to just work back from whatever period we're comfortable with to, which turns we should have.

211
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.130
stokes: Okay, yeah, and maybe just to refresh everyone, weak subjectivity…

212
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:42.149
stokes: weak subjectivity. Number one is a mouthful to say. Number two, you know, the way to think about this is, how often do I need to come online as a node? And, you know, I think…

213
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:53.009
stokes: A heuristic we'd probably all agree to is that, you know, if you are running a node, it's pretty much always online. If you're not online, that's when this will come into play.

214
00:33:53.130 --> 00:34:08.960
stokes: And, you know, let's say we go with the EIP, like Francisco was saying, the period comes down to, like, 6 days. That would mean that if I'm offline as a node for more than 6 days, I would need some piece of external information to know what, quote, the correct chain is, right?

215
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:19.980
stokes: An interesting thing here is, you know, we've had this notion from the very beginning of the beacon chain, and something we've kind of had more of since is this notion of checkpoint sync.

216
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:27.979
stokes: So, you know, point being, there is, like, I think much better infrastructure for getting this information, to know what the corrupt chain is.

217
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.659
stokes: And yeah, generally, I think it's, yeah, more…

218
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:38.999
stokes: at least to me, I feel more comfortable shortening this period. Again, I don't… yeah, I don't have a view on the exact number, but…

219
00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:48.080
stokes: I think we can do this, again, given the benefits, which, again, would be much better stake in UX, which is something that comes up, quite a bit, so…

220
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:59.670
stokes: There is a little side discussion here. Ansgar, brings this up, okay, essentially touching issuance.

221
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:06.169
stokes: I don't know, Ozgar, do you want to give a comment to this, just so people have it on their radars as they're considering the CIP?

222
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:20.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I mean, just that we've, in the last two years, had several conversations around the future of issuance on Ethereum. I think the situation is that many people have this belief that the pound issuance curve,

223
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:34.820
Ansgar Dietrichs: Well, at some point, need adjustments, but at the same time, also, part of this experience was to say, hey, actually, there's many, many stakeholders, around staking, so we really have to be careful with this conversation and with changes, and basically, like.

224
00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:45.299
Ansgar Dietrichs: Have any… anything that would ever touch issuance be very, like… have a lot of, like, look-ahead time, where we would basically, like, introduce changes,

225
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:49.759
Ansgar Dietrichs: With very long, kind of, lead times, longer than normal for changes.

226
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:54.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: And as part of that, also, there was this adjustment of the,

227
00:35:54.950 --> 00:36:07.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: the turn limit, or basically, like, this kind of this cap that, that was introduced, and part of the motivation was to say, okay, we just have a bound now on how quickly

228
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:15.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: the situation around issuance can change, right? So the issuance, obviously, is a function of how many… how much ETH is staked in total, so the… the… the,

229
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:33.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: basically, like, for exits, in a way, it really doesn't matter so much, because, yeah, that just gets us back to kind of issue… validation situation that we had in the past. Entries, basically, is the potential thing that can really start changing the situation quite a bit, and so…

230
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:50.289
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, one implication of the CRP that I personally would not like is that it basically… I would say it is almost in itself an issuance change, because it… or, like, at least it's changing the system that is kind of generally connected to issuance, and so I personally would

231
00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:56.879
Ansgar Dietrichs: Already say that that should follow the rule of no, kind of, last-minute changes to, or, like, no kind of, like, short-term changes.

232
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:06.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: But also, more, more, more, more concretely, it basically would mean that, if there was a shift in

233
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:12.790
Ansgar Dietrichs: Environment where, basically, you know, you can imagine, like, many new entities that all want to stake.

234
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:28.010
Ansgar Dietrichs: that between us seeing that the entry queue would be completely backed up, and us being able to, like, to make any changes to issuance, to react to that, there would no longer be enough time, right? So basically, it would mean that

235
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:41.649
Ansgar Dietrichs: between the start of that backlog and the time that we could see 70, 80% staked, that there wouldn't even be necessarily a hard work anymore, because it could go so quick.

236
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:50.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, so I personally, would… would probably, consider at least having… having this ERP modified to not touch the…

237
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:55.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: the entry, speed, and only modify the ABAS.

238
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.519
stokes: Okay. Yeah.

239
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:15.620
stokes: I mean, I guess I'll just add a comment here. Personal take. I feel like if we were to look at the queue and see, oh, it's suddenly too big, and then try to transition some response, that would be, also a thorny thing to do.

240
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:25.029
stokes: Because one, we'd have to, like, roll out a change pretty quickly, I think, you know, much faster than our historic hardcore cadence, and also, it's just, like…

241
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.760
stokes: You know, you can ask the question, at what point does that change?

242
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:34.010
stokes: You know, the guarantees people thought they had when they entered versus when they actually activate.

243
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:36.580
stokes: But then…

244
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:45.120
Ansgar Dietrichs: authentic guidance that we have… sorry, I don't want to interrupt you, but, like, for example, with stakeholders like, Lido, we've talked a lot in the past,

245
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:59.550
Ansgar Dietrichs: You know, because again, they obviously, like, just, like, an example of, also others, like, just mentioning them, because they're the biggest, maybe, example of people that have to make forward-looking decisions based on, based on, kind of, their emissions, and one thing we've always been saying is basically, like, hey, look.

246
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: Normally, under normal conditions, kind of like an issuance change would probably be something we, like.

247
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.789
Ansgar Dietrichs: A obviously would be up for the community anyway, but, like.

248
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:26.390
Ansgar Dietrichs: from our side, we would recommend, from the time something like this is again introduced into the discussion, we would probably want to, like, have a year and a half, two years at least, between it being first proposed and it going live. The one circumstance in which that could have to be a bit faster would be specifically if

249
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:34.809
Ansgar Dietrichs: there's a big backlog of the entry queue. And so, basically, that's always the one thing that we point to at, like, is, like, the one kind of circumstance under which

250
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: If you might have to act faster.

251
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:43.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: But at least might have dried faster, still within reasonable speed, like, even today, like, with…

252
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:50.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: it is actually quite slow for the inflow. And I think, again, that would just change now.

253
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.669
Ansgar Dietrichs: with this, EIP,

254
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:57.910
Ansgar Dietrichs: That would make me, if we were to accept it as is, that would make me, for example.

255
00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:07.989
Ansgar Dietrichs: probably start working on a concrete issue and change proposal for H-star, because I think otherwise it would no longer be responsible to have too much of a kind of time

256
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:17.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: whether the chain is that vulnerable to large changes in stake percentage. So, just wanted to flag it. Again, like, I think…

257
00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:23.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: And it would also not be the end of the world, but I think it would meaningfully change the dynamics around issuance.

258
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:38.980
stokes: Okay, yeah, that's a good… that's a good call-out. And yeah, maybe just to, like, play that back a bit. So, to be clear, this does not change the issuance curve, like, it does touch on the mechanics around issuance, like Ansvar was just pointing out.

259
00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:57.480
stokes: You know, this is not something, like, in the past, even in proof-of-work Ethereum, where we, like, quote, change the issuance. This does not do that. It does change mechanics around how quickly things can change within the current system, and then there are these second or even third-order effects, like Anzara was just saying, so…

260
00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:59.300
stokes: Point being is…

261
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:10.850
stokes: For people today, as you go to look in CIP, again, over the next couple weeks, it might look like a pretty simple change, but there are, definitely, again, second-order effects to keep in mind.

262
00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:19.039
stokes: Okay, I think that's enough for that one, and yeah, thank you everyone for the context there.

263
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:25.480
stokes: Let's see what's next. Okay, yeah, a few more here, so…

264
00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:31.840
stokes: Anders had a comment, that he had. I think there were 3 different EIPs, I guess 2 now.

265
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:43.540
stokes: And that's because Mikhail has another one, and this is touching on, yeah, a number of different things. So, at a high level.

266
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.980
stokes: We've been thinking quite a bit about consolidations.

267
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:56.790
stokes: And, you know, I will throw out this sort of, main, main desire or constraint, which is that we want to consolidate the validator set.

268
00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:06.200
stokes: If you look at adoption, so far, since Spectra, you know, it is actually… like, if you look at the adoption chart just in itself, it's trending up and right, which is cool.

269
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.060
stokes: But overall adoption's, you know, pretty low.

270
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:18.249
stokes: There's a number of reasons for this, even as simple as, like, you know, I think there's not great tooling, and that's something we can, you know, very easily improve, very quickly.

271
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:35.300
stokes: But then, once you start looking into this more deeply, there are a number of things we could think about, to make this better, and essentially, in some sense, incentivize consolidations, to set us up for things down the line, like single-slot finality, or other things that greatly benefit from a smaller validator set.

272
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:41.240
stokes: So, that all being said, either Mikhail or Anders, if you'd like to speak

273
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.579
stokes: Briefly, about your EIPs, that would be helpful.

274
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.059
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, I can, start,

275
00:42:49.250 --> 00:43:01.609
Anders Elowsson: So there's two APs that essentially just make it such that, because we want to transition people from the skimming validators to the compounding validators.

276
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:12.410
Anders Elowsson: And so there are two AIPs that, because the skimming validators, the original ones, CO1s, they actually have benefits over the CO2 validators.

277
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:22.009
Anders Elowsson: Both when it comes to the skipping function, which they don't need to pay for the withdrawal, even though it imposes some load.

278
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:24.239
Anders Elowsson: on the protocol.

279
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:36.570
Anders Elowsson: So, the first one, EIP8062, just attaches a fee, then, to the sweep withdrawal accounting, roughly for the load that it imposes.

280
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.250
Anders Elowsson: And it's taken out as 0.25% of the withdrawal amount.

281
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:44.170
Anders Elowsson: And the idea, then, is that,

282
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.000
Anders Elowsson: That, that we make it…

283
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.479
Anders Elowsson: Slightly more favorable to go over to the compounding validators and then consolidate them.

284
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:58.549
Anders Elowsson: And the second issue, and the benefit that the skimming validators have.

285
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.839
Anders Elowsson: Is that, they have,

286
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:08.190
Anders Elowsson: They have, on average, around 0.75…

287
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:28.219
Anders Elowsson: EATH of effective balance that is working to their yield that the compounding validators do not. So, a skimming validator is very capital efficient. All of the staked EATH is counting towards the effective balance, whereas a compounding validator

288
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:44.389
Anders Elowsson: Only, only, only because… because, you know, they… there's this high stress function, and they… they do not get, accounted for the balance until you… you… you go up onto the next band, and for this reason.

289
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:48.359
Anders Elowsson: You… you lose out on staking it, because you have

290
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.859
Anders Elowsson: That is to say, 0.75E this.

291
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:58.160
Anders Elowsson: stake, counting towards, Your Honor, Your Honor. Awards.

292
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:06.170
Anders Elowsson: And so, this, this EIP, 8 to 68, has a neutral effective balance design.

293
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:14.170
Anders Elowsson: So that, that the compounding validators, have, on average, the balance…

294
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:18.760
Anders Elowsson: counting towards the effective balance, in ambient folk.

295
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:35.059
Anders Elowsson: That's also… there's also another issue with the current, effective balance calculation, is that you can withdraw down to… if you have a compounding validator, you can withdraw down to 32.75 ETH, for example.

296
00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:43.769
Anders Elowsson: but account for 33 in effective balance. And so you can increase your yield by using a compounding validators.

297
00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.470
Anders Elowsson: But not… Consolidating it into a big validator, you just use a small one.

298
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.589
Anders Elowsson: We want to avoid that also, so 868.

299
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.050
Anders Elowsson: Justice this, this is true.

300
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:06.950
stokes: Okay, thanks. Yeah, your audio, the volumes seem to be oscillating a bit,

301
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:17.470
stokes: But then, yeah, to play back at least what I understood from that, so the first EAP8062, this would basically…

302
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:29.249
stokes: say that if you're a validator in the automatic, sweep with what I think we're still calling partial withdrawals today, it basically adds some, like, very small percentage fraction of fee.

303
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.439
stokes: Basically, you just, like, would burn the extra ETH,

304
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.339
stokes: And this is a small incentive to move to a consolidated validator, so that you don't have this behavior.

305
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:44.529
stokes: The second one, I haven't had much time to digest. It sounds like it tweaks

306
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:49.160
stokes: The balances work, and it gives some better properties to consolidation.

307
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.250
stokes: I don't know if that was a fair summary, Anders.

308
00:46:53.050 --> 00:47:02.349
Anders Elowsson: Exactly. The second one, it makes it such that you're essentially doing a rounding to the nearest integer when you compute your effective balance.

309
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:12.419
stokes: I'm gonna… And that's better for compounding validators, just given how the compounding actually works.

310
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:26.499
Anders Elowsson: Right now, they get the effective balance bump. They only bump up to, for example, if they reach 35.25 ETH, that's when they reach 35.

311
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:35.550
Anders Elowsson: So if they have, like, 35.1 ETH, they only get 34 ETH of effective balance.

312
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:39.970
stokes: Agree.

313
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:47.459
stokes: Gotcha. So, okay, those two. Any questions?

314
00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.839
stokes: Otherwise, just put them on our stack.

315
00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:05.129
stokes: And if not, then, Mikael, I think you have the next one here. This was… oh yeah, so preventing consolidations as withdrawals.

316
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:11.840
stokes: Yeah, there's a little bit of context here around this. Mikael, do you want to take it over?

317
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:14.439
Mikhail Kalinin: Yep. Okay.

318
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:25.280
Mikhail Kalinin: So… Yeah, BCIP prevents consolidations of withdrawals, as Alex said.

319
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:33.919
Mikhail Kalinin: Today there is a… the consolidation mechanism designed in a way that if the target…

320
00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:41.269
Mikhail Kalinin: Target validator, after consolidation, gets the balance that exceeds the max effective balance.

321
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.039
Mikhail Kalinin: The advocacy will, will be withdrawn, basically, by this week.

322
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:52.359
Mikhail Kalinin: And We see that, these,

323
00:48:52.520 --> 00:49:03.879
Mikhail Kalinin: let's call it a feature. This feature has been recently heavily exploited, because there is an imbalance between the exit and consolidation queues.

324
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:12.390
Mikhail Kalinin: So, yeah, it requires, of course, it requires 2,048 ETH validator, but yeah, that's,

325
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.049
Mikhail Kalinin: Obviously possible for staking pools.

326
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:27.510
Mikhail Kalinin: And, yeah, of course, important to mention that consolidations were never meant to, because this way, consolidation short was never meant to be used as,

327
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.950
Mikhail Kalinin: As exit… as the exit churn.

328
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.360
Mikhail Kalinin: And, this CIP basically,

329
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:42.140
Mikhail Kalinin: It's a fix to this problem, and what it does, it just cancels the consolidation request if the target will

330
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:46.999
Mikhail Kalinin: The target effective balance will exceed the max effective balance.

331
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:53.509
Mikhail Kalinin: After consolidation. It also takes into account pending consolidations that are in the queue.

332
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.980
Mikhail Kalinin: Yeah, that's… that's what it is.

333
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:00.840
stokes: Cool.

334
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:09.660
stokes: What's your sense of… how important this is to having in Amsterdam. Like…

335
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:17.640
stokes: It seems like this is the nice to have, but it's not necessarily critical, or do you think it's, yeah, more important to go ahead and patch?

336
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:34.140
Mikhail Kalinin: Yeah, true, it's… yeah, I forgot to mention, which is also important, it's not a security issue, it's more kind of UX, problem. And, it also depends on how long do we want to, how long we want consolidations to,

337
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:42.219
Mikhail Kalinin: remain as a feature in the protocol. Because when we were introducing consolidations, one of the thoughts was that this is a temporal thing.

338
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:48.270
Mikhail Kalinin: Until we see, A good consolidation level.

339
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.139
Mikhail Kalinin: In the validator set.

340
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:58.529
Mikhail Kalinin: But, As, for me personally, it's an open question when we can, fabricate consolidations, so…

341
00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:12.329
Mikhail Kalinin: Yeah, it's, it's, it's really a nice-to-have feature. It's not, it's not super important, there is no security issue with that, but it's also, it's also a quite simple change.

342
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:21.680
Mikhail Kalinin: So, yeah, that's kind of… it's trade-offs, and yeah, I think…

343
00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.200
Mikhail Kalinin: Just make a decision to have it or not.

344
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:29.810
stokes: Okay, great. Yeah, thanks for the overview.

345
00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:38.889
stokes: So, okay, there's that basket of three things that touches some of the mechanics here around, staking and the UX there.

346
00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:51.900
stokes: So, let's see, okay, I think we're good there, and the next thing would be cell-level deltas and PureDust. Raul wanted to say something here.

347
00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:52.840
stokes: And it…

348
00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.379
Raúl Kripalani: That's a bitch.

349
00:51:53.380 --> 00:52:00.959
stokes: Here is there's, you know, some changes that aren't necessarily in consensus, but definitely touch on things we want to do.

350
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:09.389
stokes: to keep scaling bulbs, and definitely something to keep, in mind as we think about scoping. But yeah, we'll take it from here.

351
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:34.299
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, so just to… hey, hey everybody, so just to kind of, like, guide the discussion, I have some materials here. They're very short, I just took the ability to share them. So, just wanted to give, first of all, a TLDR of what peer cell-level deltas are. They're a CL-side network optimization that eliminates the need to transmit redundant column information and data during the critical path, during the burstiest path.

352
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:59.290
Raúl Kripalani: of, activity in the network. And it does so by leveraging partial blob data that's available in the EL blob pool. If you all remember, there was kind of, like, a discussion a few months ago around get blobs v3, and that method in the engine API, and that method powering the solution. Well, this is basically it, and we've been working hard towards it, and I just kind of, like, wanted to present the status of affairs and next steps here.

353
00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:01.310
Raúl Kripalani: So…

354
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:14.240
Raúl Kripalani: what nodes do is they construct poems by exchanging and reconciling cells with one another, and this is implemented as a gossip sub extension. And a gossip sub extension is basically a

355
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:22.150
Raúl Kripalani: a piece of… a functionality that is negotiated between two parties when they establish a gossip… when they handshake on GossipSub.

356
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:38.580
Raúl Kripalani: Which, is precisely what makes this solution, backwards compatible, there is no consensus impact, and it's deployable gradually in the network by different clients, different, different operators at different points in time, and, that's why it can be done XFORK.

357
00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:54.609
Raúl Kripalani: So, yeah, we're kind of, like, chatting about this in the context of Lamstam, but just kind of, like, to reiterate what Alex said, this is, like, the intention is to deploy this solution next work. So, the motivation, for this is that it allows us to unlock the next tranche of BPOs.

358
00:53:54.610 --> 00:54:09.799
Raúl Kripalani: Going from the 21 max that we have right now in the schedule, all the way up to 72 blobs max, at least. There is a possibility that we can go even further with just this optimization, and kind of like some other minor optimizations that we're working with, with client implementers directly.

359
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:31.170
Raúl Kripalani: We predict that the next bottleneck is gonna be the EL Blob Pool, and to kind of, like, deal with that, we submitted an EIP, for Glamstadam. It was just submitted yesterday, you might have not seen it yet, but it's titled Sparse Blob Pool. So, I'll post a set of links in a bit, in the chat so that you can start looking at that material as well.

360
00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:36.730
Raúl Kripalani: So, the early results, and these are, like, caveat, massive caveat, these are…

361
00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:51.399
Raúl Kripalani: just from small dev nets, they are really promising. They're showing an average reduction of 10x in column traffic during propagation. Remember, during the burstiest part of this flood and the critical path.

362
00:54:51.400 --> 00:55:08.529
Raúl Kripalani: And this is extrapolating the current rate of public versus unseen blobs in the blob pool, right? So, there are some charts there, the… they look at it, like, a little bit… like, it doesn't seem like a 10x, but that's because the axes are actually, different orders of magnitude.

363
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:31.709
Raúl Kripalani: The current status of implementation is that we've got a Prism prototype ready, and it's being reviewed by the team, so thanks a lot, Casey. And another shout-out to the Lighthouse team, who's already gotten started with the implementation, and the prototype. The gossip sub side of things are almost… are ready, I think, and Daniel is working on the client-side implementation of this.

364
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:47.230
Raúl Kripalani: So, in terms of BPO schedule, this is what we're thinking. The core notion here is, can we provide a smooth continuation of the current planned BPO scheduled by basically appending the next tranche

365
00:55:47.230 --> 00:56:00.700
Raúl Kripalani: which, here we're differentiating calling them BPO Plan and BPOnext. So, this could be a potential BPO schedule, and… and there are some dates there, I'll talk through them in a second. But basically the key… the key points here is that the…

366
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:10.610
Raúl Kripalani: So, if we continue the schedule, then the next one would be BP03, the next work would be BP03. That could come around February 26th?

367
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:16.939
Raúl Kripalani: And, it would just be a small parameter bump to ensure that everything looks nominal under… under…

368
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:33.399
Raúl Kripalani: with sellable deltas. From there on, the idea would be, to spike, to increase max further, so that we can see what the network, how the network is performing, and we can analyze how the network is performing with burst year…

369
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.479
Raúl Kripalani: spikes, but not sustained spikes. And then from there onwards, we would just

370
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:54.759
Raúl Kripalani: start doing constant, if everything looks good, we will start doing a constant, increment of, like, of what you see there is, like, 32, 48, 48, 64, and 64, 72. Basically on, every two weeks, there would be a BPO, fork here.

371
00:56:54.790 --> 00:57:03.270
Raúl Kripalani: Now, this is, just a very indicative, speculative timeline, of how this could progress.

372
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:21.380
Raúl Kripalani: So, we're currently at the implementation stage, as I said. We are intending to perform… to run larger DevNets, and this is… we're using… we're helping… we're getting a ton of help from… from Sunnyside Labs for that. That's currently in progress.

373
00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:40.169
Raúl Kripalani: The next step would be interoping with Lighthouse, and through that, we'll end up… we'll continue iterating on the design, and specifically closing some of the open points around early, or eager pushes from, for example, relays, or no

374
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:45.929
Raúl Kripalani: precisely which blobs are private and which have been publicly available? Can those relays just push?

375
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:57.360
Raúl Kripalani: The delta that is necessary for the network to reconcile, what assumptions can we make about the network-wide availability of blobs in the blob pool, and things like that.

376
00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:11.109
Raúl Kripalani: as what we'll be, I think, polishing and kind of, like, fine-tuning. And then there are some… some other technical questions about the schema around, do we include the block headers or not, within… within the partial messages.

377
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:20.930
Raúl Kripalani: Now, what I wanted to call out here is, by November, we expect to have a final version of the spec that is fully interoperable, that is seen, like.

378
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:36.320
Raúl Kripalani: full interoperability, and at that point, I think the idea would be for the Get Blobs v3 engine API operation to be shipped in all execution clients in preparation for this, and this basically means a rehash of

379
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:47.109
Raúl Kripalani: I think all ELs actually had a PR that they, that they closed down when we de-scoped this one for Saga, so that would be rehashing that PR and merging it.

380
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:58.799
Raúl Kripalani: And then, by November, I would like to see the rest of the implementations, members take one Lodestar beginning to implement, and by December, if we can have them already.

381
00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:08.539
Raúl Kripalani: And such that we start getting them in production-grade state, and we start battle testing them with larger and larger and larger testnets. I would like to

382
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:28.120
Raúl Kripalani: kind of, like, walk into the winter holidays with a BPOnext schedule proposed, that would be… that would be amazing. And then when we're back, we… I would like us to… like, the idea would be to commit to that schedule, and to make the releases, and to kind of, like, start the… the more formal… the initial releases, and start the more formal testnet

383
00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:46.150
Raúl Kripalani: journey up until Maynet. Some of these dates might shift. As I said, this is very indicative, but, like, the intention of this is basically to align us all against a common timeline, and I'm very happy to take feedback and input and refine this further based on feasibility and other workloads.

384
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:50.660
Raúl Kripalani: That, that client teams are also, engaging in.

385
00:59:50.920 --> 01:00:15.879
Raúl Kripalani: Cool. So, basically, what's next? We are… the next steps, as I said, we're running larger testnets and conducting battle testing, conducting interrupt tests, as Lighthouse also gets ready, against the Prism prototype, and then the asks for implementers here would be for the CL implementers. Please, if you haven't engaged with this work yet, then please review, comment on the specs, and start planning implementation.

386
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:28.770
Raúl Kripalani: I'll share these materials after, after, after the call today, so you, so you can use them as a reference. And, and yeah, and then for EL implementers, as I said, this is…

387
01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:41.559
Raúl Kripalani: minimal impact to the EL, practically zero impact if it wasn't for GetBloxv3, so… and for which most of… most of ELs already have a PR, so, get ready to rehatch that PR, essentially. And…

388
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:48.910
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, so I'm very happy to take questions or thoughts, ideas, anything. Also happy to discuss off-end.

389
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.430
Raúl Kripalani: Thanks.

390
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:53.969
stokes: Thank you. Yeah, that was a great overview.

391
01:00:54.430 --> 01:01:02.250
stokes: And… yeah. I think I'd just remind everyone that the general theme of Amsterdam, and essentially, you know.

392
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:05.880
stokes: The present time and the foreseeable future is scaling.

393
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:18.259
stokes: That might have been a lot from the presentation that we just saw from Earl, but again, it all goes towards scaling, scaling, so… critical work, and something to keep in mind.

394
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:29.010
stokes: Especially if you look at, the other PSI EIPs, and you're like, oh, you know, there's not this much, you know, these are, like, one-line changes, we'll just put this here and here.

395
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:34.879
stokes: Keep in mind, you know, we very much also want to keep doing, the work Raul was just pointing to, so…

396
01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:39.959
stokes: that's, I think, gonna have impacts, for the other EIPs we select for Amsterdam.

397
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.260
stokes: Any questions?

398
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.120
stokes: From what Raul said.

399
01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:03.120
stokes: Okay, one thing, we can do offline roll is just get that information you just shared, just somewhere,

400
01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:09.260
stokes: I think public. It might be in some place, but yeah, we'll just get it somewhere just so people can refer to it.

401
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.819
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, I'll follow up on that.

402
01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:15.010
stokes: Otherwise, cool. Yeah, that was… that was great. Thanks for the overview.

403
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:18.010
stokes: Okay.

404
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:21.310
stokes: Now, there's one question here.

405
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:28.190
stokes: Maybe 2. Okay, so, like, clients asking, do seals feel good about another 3 BPOs while finishing glamps are down?

406
01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:37.120
stokes: My general comment to this is kind of what I was just getting at, is that, you know, I think we can scope ClapterDam in a way where this is definitely doable.

407
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:48.420
stokes: If we aren't thinking about these non-consensus changes on the networking layer, and just put in every last, you know, CL EIP into Glenster Dam, that's where things could start to be a little…

408
01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.590
stokes: Tight, but…

409
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:55.559
stokes: Yeah, I think there's certainly a path here, so that's something we should just reason about as we go to scope.

410
01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.860
stokes: I don't know if any other SEAL team wants to chime in.

411
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.810
stokes: To like Clan's question?

412
01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:14.620
stokes: Okay, Enrico here's asking, well, partial message extension… okay, it looks like you guys are handling that in the chat.

413
01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:18.320
stokes: Yeah, just chime in if you'd want to speak up live.

414
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:25.379
stokes: And there's still a conversation going around the staking stuff. I'll just let that be for now.

415
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:28.880
stokes: Okay.

416
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:33.660
stokes: Matt says, I'd like to hear from the actual CL teams. Anyone want to chime in?

417
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:51.960
stokes: I think folks might need some time to digest. So, you know, let's… let's just take this to the next call.

418
01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.049
stokes: Okay, we did get it, I think we'll be fine, from Kini.

419
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:11.519
stokes: Okay, so yeah, again, I think today, I just want to surface, you know, all the options with the different, EIPs.

420
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:15.819
stokes: And get us thinking about, scoping. So, the…

421
01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:22.699
stokes: idea then is that we have another two weeks to actually form opinions, so we can hash it out on next ACDC, so…

422
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.039
stokes: I think we're good for there for now.

423
01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:40.310
stokes: And… let me see what's next on the agenda. Okay, so the last one here is, Fossil, which is, you know, a little bit special than the others, which is why I kind of put it last here. So, yeah, EAP7805.

424
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:47.510
stokes: This one was CFI'd, essentially because it was not selected as a headliner for Amsterdam.

425
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:54.180
stokes: But, yeah, the decision made at the time was to CFI it and just kind of put it to the side.

426
01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:00.759
stokes: So this is another one that, we can have on the table as we go to scope the fork.

427
01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:06.459
stokes: And… We've said quite a bit about it already,

428
01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:10.480
stokes: Let's see… I'm trying to see if there are any authors here on the call.

429
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:11.830
soispoke: Yep.

430
01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:14.020
stokes: If anyone would like to say something. Oh yeah, go ahead.

431
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:26.800
soispoke: Yeah, I'm… yeah, it's gonna be short, because I do think a lot of, things have been said around Fossil, and yeah, I… yeah, things haven't, like, drastically changed, I guess, and…

432
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:36.599
soispoke: It still seems like most people, like, amongst the community, but also core devs and researchers, like, agree about the importance of, like, shipping fossil at some point.

433
01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:45.209
soispoke: Because, you know, it does basically allow you to keep scaling without, like, hurting some of the fundamental properties we really care about.

434
01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:57.080
soispoke: But yeah, most of the disagreements, I guess, seem to be focused around when false should be shipped, and so, you know, there are concerns around false scope and…

435
01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:04.690
soispoke: If the Roman upgrades needing to ship on a regular cadence, which I think is so important, people call that fork discipline, I guess.

436
01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:14.090
soispoke: And so there, like, given the readiness of Fossil, that's now, you know, having interrupt between 2 EL clients and 4 CL clients.

437
01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:25.129
soispoke: I don't know, there seems to be rough agreement around Fossil, maybe realistically adding, like, a two-month delay to Glamsterdam timelines, but of course, it's very, very hard to tell in advance.

438
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:32.310
soispoke: And that being said, yeah, I think one aspect of the decision that wasn't really mentioned explicitly before

439
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:38.850
soispoke: is, quote-unquote, the shipping environment. And so, by that I mean, like.

440
01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:50.089
soispoke: I don't know, governance, political landscape, institutional adoption, like, state TTFs and stuff like this, and how it might affect, like, proposals like, like, like Forsol, but also, you know.

441
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:55.660
soispoke: privacy ones or issuance CIPs that are also, like, sort of, like, touched by these considerations.

442
01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.799
soispoke: in opposition to, like, I don't know, like, scaling EIPs, or…

443
01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:05.910
soispoke: or shorter slots, or whatever, that are not just, like, super affected by it, I guess.

444
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:17.679
soispoke: And, yeah, here I think the equation is, like, actually quite simple. It's like, either you think there is both a very, very high probability of fossil shipping in a later fork.

445
01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:34.869
soispoke: That's… yeah, that's all assuming you like Fossil and you want it shipped at some point. So yeah, either you think high probability of Fossil shipping in a later fork, and a very high probability of the shipping environment, let's say, staying as friendly as it is today.

446
01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:40.989
soispoke: By friendly, I mean, yeah, it includes, like, strong support from the community,

447
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:59.520
soispoke: And there is momentum behind it, you know, you see even, like, builders being pro-fossil. There's actually not much censorship on the network right now, and there is a sort of, like, friendly political landscape, that looks generally favorable to these upgrades.

448
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:13.110
soispoke: And in that case, like, if you think that those… both of those probabilities are very high, I think, like, yeah, you might just favor, like, shipping cadence and process, and decide against including fossil in Amsterdam.

449
01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:26.640
soispoke: But the alternative, I guess, is, like, if you think shipping foresaw will only be increasingly difficult over time, and basically the more we wait, the more we expose the protocol to, you know, censorship, or, like.

450
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:37.310
soispoke: bad things we don't want to see on the network, and maybe, like, pressure from parties that will see risks in allowing AIPs like Fossil to be included in future forks.

451
01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:44.260
soispoke: then I think you might lean in favor of including it, just, like, as soon as possible, which means in Amsterdam.

452
01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:48.909
soispoke: And so I think, yeah, regardless of what side people end up on, I think it's…

453
01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:58.919
soispoke: nice to at least include this dimension when forming an opinion for sole inclusion, because I do think it's an important decision to make for Ethereum.

454
01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:08.540
soispoke: And, yeah, I wanted to end with a small anecdote. I was checking out the new website by, let's called institutions.ethereum.org yesterday.

455
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:21.469
soispoke: And there are… Ethereum was described as, like, a network with no single point of failure, no central coordinator, no pause button, and resilient to geopolitical, regulatory, and infrastructural level risks.

456
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:31.240
soispoke: I think, yeah, I thought that was quite well put, but I guess my personal opinion is that I think we need to back those claims up a bit more.

457
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:39.969
stokes: Okay, thank you. Yeah, that was a nice overview. And…

458
01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:48.839
stokes: Yeah, I mean, I think just to maybe summarize that a bit, I think Anskar put it well here in the chat, that, yeah, there's, you know, kind of this trade-off to make between

459
01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:57.769
stokes: On the one hand, like, so I spoke was saying, you know, we want to, you know, not add too much uncertainty to constrained timelines.

460
01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.500
stokes: At the same time, there are…

461
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:09.149
stokes: interesting second-order implications to this EIP, and EIPs like it. So, something to think about.

462
01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:16.259
stokes: I think that's… Perhaps enough on that for the moment.

463
01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.099
stokes: Would anyone like to add anything?

464
01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:29.900
stokes: Okay.

465
01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:40.909
stokes: So, let's see, I think these were all the CL, not headliner, PFID IPs.

466
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:45.459
stokes: That we had. Or, yeah, at least non-headlinear.

467
01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:48.560
stokes: EIPs, regardless of inclusion status.

468
01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:57.389
stokes: And that should give us a good overview. Again, thank you everyone who, just engaged and gave us, you know, overviews of the different EIPs.

469
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:05.890
stokes: there's, you know, it does feel like there's actually quite a bit here once we get into it, even if, you know, on paper it's just a small number of EIPs.

470
01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:12.629
stokes: The EL side of this will be fun, as a tangential comment, but…

471
01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.770
stokes: Either way, yeah, so that should be a good overview.

472
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.419
stokes: And there's a few more things I wanted to get to today, so…

473
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:26.980
stokes: Okay, one clarification, because, yeah, AP Kotap, brought this up.

474
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:39.940
stokes: So, I'll grab a link to this comment here. While I was proposing, we have, written opinions two weeks from now, and I said we would move these things to SFI.

475
01:11:40.150 --> 01:11:51.410
stokes: I should be more precise, because, yeah, how we generally do this is that we would CFI things, and then, kind of have this lockstep process where…

476
01:11:51.890 --> 01:12:03.850
stokes: The things that are on DevNets right now are SFI'd, everything else would be CFI'd, and only once we're ready to add another EIP to the DevNets would we move from CFI to SFI.

477
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:14.129
stokes: And, you know, we've kind of added this discipline, let's say, over the last couple cycles, and it's really helpful just to keep, you know, things kind of focused and organized.

478
01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:18.260
stokes: Otherwise, we'll kind of just end up biting off more than we can chew.

479
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:22.120
stokes: Which we don't want to do, so…

480
01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:27.560
stokes: What that would mean then, precisely, is that on the next call, you know, we will…

481
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.490
stokes: Come back to the scoping discussion and try to make decisions on what to pre-ify.

482
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:45.290
stokes: You know, just so it's clear, if we decide to not include fossil, then we would take it out of the CFI set print out, but then the plan then would be to have the CFI set determined, on the next ACDC,

483
01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.379
stokes: Again, at least on the CL side.

484
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:56.570
stokes: And then, we'd keep EPBS SFI as is, and keep moving forward. And then from there, we'd have the clan stream scope settled.

485
01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:08.159
stokes: we keep moving forward, you know, as we get through things on DevNets, we'd start with the SFI EIPs on DevNets, and then, yeah, start moving EIPs one by one, as we're ready for those. So…

486
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:11.140
stokes: Yeah, thanks for the shoutout there.

487
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:12.559
stokes: A.B. Kota.

488
01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.509
stokes: And… that should be good there.

489
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.149
stokes: I think that's all I wanted to say.

490
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:29.440
stokes: on that. There's a few H-star things to cover before we wrap up, but before we do that, any other Glamsterdam comments?

491
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:36.190
stokes: Anything around scoping, or the EIPs, or anything else.

492
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:46.140
stokes: Okay.

493
01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:49.630
stokes: Then we'll turn to H-star.

494
01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.779
stokes: The main thing for H-star is just to pick the name.

495
01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:57.569
stokes: And… yeah, let's look at that now. So…

496
01:13:58.090 --> 01:14:00.780
stokes: There's this informal poll here.

497
01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:07.520
stokes: That, if anything, is great for signaling. Let's see if I can grab a link… there we go, to just the full…

498
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.779
stokes: So if you take a look, at this here.

499
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:16.480
stokes: There's a number of proposals, these should all be stars that start with H, which is our schema.

500
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:24.869
stokes: And the leading proposal right now, it's kind of a toss-up between HECA or Alvedios. Heca is the leading candidate.

501
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:28.430
stokes: And… yeah, I think we should just go ahead and pick one.

502
01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.149
stokes: And following the poll, let's just go with HECA.

503
01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:34.389
stokes: Everyone okay with that?

504
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:41.109
stokes: Okay, God, it works for me.

505
01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:54.199
stokes: A. Bikotop was nice to put some possible portmanteaus here, you know, so we have the seal and eel names. On the EL, this is the Bogota fork that we would be discussing, so Hecca and Bogota could perhaps be HECTA.

506
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:59.239
stokes: Hogota, I don't know, there's some options here that we can, see what sticks.

507
01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.860
stokes: But…

508
01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:09.070
stokes: In terms of today, we'd move forward with HECA, and that would be H-star, and we can finally have a name, and stop calling it H-star.

509
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:15.410
stokes: The most common hair is funny, heck of yes.

510
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.120
stokes: Okay, cool. So let's go ahead and do HECA.

511
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:25.940
stokes: And, yeah, we'll just see. People will come in with portmanteaus, and one of them will invariably stick, and we'll go with that.

512
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:36.830
stokes: Cool. So, okay, we've covered a lot today. Let me just scan the agenda and make sure there's nothing else we need to get to.

513
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:44.040
stokes: H star name… Okay.

514
01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:46.999
stokes: I think we're pretty good there.

515
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:53.279
stokes: Oh, okay, there was a call for a mascot. Did we ever have a mascot for Clarence Trident?

516
01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:04.850
stokes: If not, we can, discuss this on Discord or somewhere, but yeah, there's a link if you want to take a look there.

517
01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:08.409
stokes: I'm not sure what it is.

518
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:14.569
stokes: But it's something to think about if you want to put in a proposal for the mascot.

519
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:17.600
stokes: Okay.

520
01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.789
stokes: Otherwise, I think that's it for today. Any closing thoughts or comments?

521
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:39.599
stokes: Okay, if not, thank you all. Yeah, so…

522
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:49.609
stokes: Let's just quickly summarize. We have mainnet for Forsaka locked in. That's big. Again, congrats, everyone, getting this point, and let's see it through to the end.

523
01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:54.149
stokes: We covered a bunch of things on Amsterdam, so, yeah, again…

524
01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:58.739
stokes: You know, your homework here is to think about scoping.

525
01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:14.029
stokes: You know, including all the PFI DIPs, thinking about, also this work with, PureDOS and blob scaling iterations, that we would also want to schedule, even if they're, you know, export in the sense of not waiting until Amsterdam, but we still want to have bandwidth for them.

526
01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:23.930
stokes: Then also cross-layer IPs, which I think Fossil's really the only cross-layer one, but then, you know, we'll probably want to be mindful of the EL side when thinking about that.

527
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:26.220
stokes: In terms of scoping.

528
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:31.779
stokes: And, yeah, then we'll move ahead with HECA as a name for H-star.

529
01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.070
stokes: Okay.

530
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.830
stokes: That should be it for the day, and yeah, thanks everyone. I'll see you next time.

531
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:53.369
stokes: Okay. Goodbye.

532
01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:54.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: Third one.

533
01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.430
Mikhail Kalinin: Bye, everyone.
