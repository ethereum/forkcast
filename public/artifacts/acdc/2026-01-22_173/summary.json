  "summary_overview": "The meeting covered updates and discussions on multiple EIPs and ePBS, including status adjustments and review requests for various EIPs. The team discussed ePBS implementation progress across clients, setting a February deadline for devnet zero and considering an EL-only fork if ePBS is not ready. They also reviewed recent technical issues with Teku nodes and discussed partial cell proofs implementation, with clients working on different stages of the SSZ library updates.",

      "label": "Fusaka EIPs",
      "summary": "The meeting focused on updates and discussions around several EIPs. Pooja requested status adjustments for EIPs 7607, 7723, 7594, and 7918, which were to be reviewed by relevant participants."

      "label": "ePBS Updates",
      "summary": "The team discussed progress on ePBS, including spec changes and the need for ePBS DevNet Zero, with Barnabas sharing notes on scoping and Ben Adams highlighting a required CL change for SlotNum EL.

      "label": "Teku Mainnet Issue",
      "summary": "The team reviewed recent issues with Teku nodes, which experienced performance problems during mainnet stress testing, and discussed a new Engine API PR related to Block Level Access lists. Finally, they noted that proposals for the Hegota fork are due February 4th, with champions requested to present their proposals by that date."

    {
      "label": "Partial Proofs Implementation Status",
      "summary": "The team discussed the implementation status of partial cell proofs and the EIP-7688 SSZ library updates. Barnabas reported that Lighthouse and Prysm have partial implementations, while Teku and Lodestar are still working on it. The team agreed to roll out partial cell proofs through devnet, testnet, and then allow clients to implement it in their next stable release. Etan confirmed that SSZ container implementation can be done parallel to ePBS and is a library change that doesn't affect consensus. Potuz expressed concern about potential issues with in-memory structures due to rehashing, and the team agreed to de-risk this point with a prototype."
