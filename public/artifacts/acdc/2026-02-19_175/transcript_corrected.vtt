00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.100
Josh Davis: Can I get a quick mic check, please?

2
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.770
Justin Florentine (Besu): You sound great.

3
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.650
stokes: Hello.

4
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.219
stokes: Let's see. Maybe one more minute, and then we'll get started.

5
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.299
stokes: Okay, Josh, are you helping with the stream? And if so, I'm ready when you are.

6
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.190
Josh Davis: Awesome. You are alive!

7
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:05.660
stokes: Hey everybody, welcome to ACDC number 175. This is issue 19-30 in the PM repo.

8
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.089
stokes: I'll drop a link to the agenda here.

9
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.049
stokes: In the Zoom chat, and… yeah, the agenda is pretty light today.

10
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:24.289
stokes: I think in large part, because the topic of the hour, the PBS dubnets, a lot of that's moved to ACDT.

11
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.950
stokes: At least while we're working on the implementations.

12
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:36.839
stokes: But yeah, that being said, let's go ahead and get into it, and yeah, maybe other topics will come up as we go. So…

13
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.869
stokes: Right. First step, Glamsterdam.

14
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:51.709
stokes: And like I said, topic of the hour, ePBS DevNet Zero, it sounds like, from ACDT this week, client teams are thinking.

15
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.010
stokes: You know, we probably want another week or two, to get to that first step nut.

16
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.709
stokes: Yeah, any, any fun updates since then worth sharing?

17
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.289
stokes: Paris says here, Kurtosis config with Lighthouse working.

18
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.009
stokes: Yeah, maybe you could say a little bit more. Does that mean, like…

19
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.020
stokes: The whole thing is working, or maybe just a part.

20
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.659
Parithosh Jayanthi: Pk's been looking into it, do you wanna give an update on that, PK?

21
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.880
pk910: what, sorry?

22
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.409
Parithosh Jayanthi: the Lighthouse ePBS DevNet that you were testing locally with Kurtosis?

23
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:41.659
pk910: Yeah, I'm just running it locally, looks pretty nice so far, yet,

24
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.339
pk910: I don't really have any updates so far,

25
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.010
pk910: I just noticed a few bugs so far, so,

26
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.860
pk910: Blocks are mostly empty, but, yeah, they… this looks…

27
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.490
pk910: It looks, pretty minor bugs so far.

28
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.980
stokes: Okay, that's good news.

29
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.259
stokes: And yeah, you know, once we have another…

30
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:13.229
stokes: one or two more clients, then we'll kind of have a stable core for DevNet, and we can keep moving forward there.

31
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:24.959
stokes: Any other client teams, or yeah, Lighthouse even, if you'd like to say more. Yeah, any other client teams, would you like to give an update on ePBS progress?

32
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.799
Parithosh Jayanthi: We expect that by next week, we have at least a second client. I think once we have two

33
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.789
Parithosh Jayanthi: maybe 3 clients were ready to launch the DevNet.

34
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.359
Parithosh Jayanthi: And that way, we'd still hit the end of February target for that.

35
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.380
stokes: Okay, yeah, Lighthouse saying…

36
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.669
stokes: There is a single client demo that they have, but a bit hacky, ready in a week or two.

37
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.159
stokes: Teku says, ready for next week? Okay, so yeah, get in there.

38
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.380
stokes: Ready for next week, you know, to try a DevNet.

39
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:26.439
stokes: And yeah, update from Prism here, a few more PRs to work through.

40
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:34.670
stokes: But okay, yeah. Yeah, generally, that's all good news. Nice work, everyone.

41
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:41.540
stokes: And… Excuse me. Yeah. So…

42
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:50.230
stokes: you know, we had said, yeah, something like end of, this month would be good, and it seems like we're more or less on track for that.

43
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.300
stokes: So…

44
00:10:52.090 --> 00:11:02.639
stokes: let's just, keep… keep moving forward, and we'll get to a .NE Zero. And I do hope from there, you know, it's,

45
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.980
stokes: Also pretty straightforward, too.

46
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.020
stokes: get to future DevNuts.

47
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.990
stokes: I would expect the bulk of the work is getting to Demo Zero.

48
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.800
stokes: But yeah, we'll see how it goes.

49
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:25.810
stokes: Okay, any other comments on ePBS DevNet Zero, the DevNet Zero spec?

50
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.169
stokes: is Alpha 2, I believe, in the Consumer Specs repo.

51
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:37.080
stokes: There have been a few other little things that have come through, but those will be for future devnets.

52
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.399
stokes: So, yeah.

53
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.760
stokes: Anything there? Any questions? Any difficulties you run into as you're implementing?

54
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.440
stokes: Anything we should discuss now?

55
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.690
stokes: Okay?

56
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.219
stokes: Then, happy ePBS.

57
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.580
stokes: And, I suppose then we'll check in on Monday.

58
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:17.540
stokes: Trent's asking, was there a decision made on the variable PTC? Yeah, that's what Justin's saying here. The PR is still open,

59
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:28.669
stokes: I don't have a link to it, but yeah, that's something. But that being said, yeah, I mean, that is probably the last big open spec question, but also we can make progress,

60
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.959
stokes: With these other dev notes, before having to resolve that.

61
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:39.770
stokes: So, still something to have on the back of our minds, but, not necessarily blocking at the moment.

62
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:48.289
stokes: But since we brought it up, were there any questions on here we should discuss now?

63
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.830
Justin Traglia: Like, regarding the PTC deadline PR.

64
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.200
stokes: Yeah.

65
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.070
stokes: Like, is… yeah, is this PR ready to go?

66
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.809
stokes: Are there other, you know, are there questions we need to talk through?

67
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.040
Justin Traglia: For that PR, I don't know.

68
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.370
stokes: Okay.

69
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.880
Justin Traglia: Jesco is leading it.

70
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.880
stokes: Okay.

71
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.690
stokes: Yeah.

72
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:23.829
stokes: It's been a little busy with East Denver, so I also have not had time to look at this too deeply yet.

73
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.070
stokes: But yeah, okay.

74
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.070
stokes: Let's just table that for now.

75
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.480
stokes: And… Yeah, okay, we'll keep everything moving forward.

76
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.549
stokes: Was that enough, Trent?

77
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.609
Trent: Yeah, no, I was just curious.

78
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.319
stokes: Yeah, okay.

79
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:58.899
stokes: My understanding is we're leaning towards it, assuming we can figure out, you know, any subtleties that might come up with it.

80
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.510
stokes: Okay.

81
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.559
stokes: Then, we'll move on to… oh, Hegota.

82
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.810
stokes: And… From there, so… yeah.

83
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.930
stokes: Today, we will pick the headliner.

84
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:27.170
stokes: We, essentially had our, deadline…

85
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.190
stokes: I'm just checking the calendar again. Yeah, so, last ACDC.

86
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:39.640
stokes: Essentially, you had data proposals together. What we got to were two headliner proposals for Hegota.

87
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.730
stokes: And let me just grab this link to Ethan Magicians.

88
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.009
stokes: So you have them here.

89
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:53.820
stokes: And there it was… EIP7805, which is FOCIL.

90
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.599
stokes: And then a proposal for partial reconstruction in 2D PeerDAS. So…

91
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.500
stokes: We had those proposals, and following the process that we currently have.

92
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:09.719
stokes: Essentially, yeah, we would go ahead and pick the headliner today.

93
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.769
stokes: These… Yeah.

94
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:21.299
stokes: I think… I think that's where we're at. I think that's a good summary. So, that being said, let's move forward.

95
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:31.150
stokes: And, yeah, so, you know, my read here is that most of the client teams, prefer FOCIL as a headliner for Hegota.

96
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.789
stokes: Would any client team, yeah, like to re…

97
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:43.980
stokes: state that opinion. We had talked about this quite a bit, you know, on previous calls,

98
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.459
stokes: So, I think we're pretty much there, but, yeah.

99
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:54.010
stokes: There's also a comment here worth calling out, on the agenda. Lido contributors support FOCIL.

100
00:15:54.140 --> 00:16:02.760
stokes: As well. So… Anyone… yeah, so Lighthouse here says, we previously stated our case, proposal.

101
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:08.270
stokes: I'm pretty sure this is where most people landed, if not everyone, as we were talking about this before.

102
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.579
stokes: So… Another confirmed for FOCIL from Tegu?

103
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:24.450
stokes: So, yeah, I would move to go ahead and lock in FOCIL as the headliner, with anyone?

104
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.690
stokes: Have any comments before we do that?

105
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.010
stokes: Okay.

106
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.660
stokes: No one's speaking up, but the comments are all very pro-FOCIL.

107
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:48.509
stokes: So… Okay, yeah, let's do that. So, FOCIL will be the headliner on the CL side for Hegota.

108
00:16:49.250 --> 00:17:00.430
stokes: I will triple check the process, just to make sure I don't do anything, incorrect here, but I believe that means we SFI FOCIL for Hegota.

109
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.150
stokes: And then we would DFI, this 2D PeerDAS proposal for now.

110
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.270
stokes: Yeah. So…

111
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:20.380
stokes: I think that was pretty easy then. I also think this tracks with, again, not just where, you know, our heads are at here on the call, but also the broader community. There's…

112
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:28.550
stokes: from what I've seen, yeah, a lot of demand for this. So… Very cool.

113
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.289
stokes: We can go ahead and say the headliner's done.

114
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:39.529
stokes: And then from here, the… I was actually trying to find this other post. So we had a timeline here.

115
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:48.990
stokes: Because then we would take until the end of this month to do this headliner process, at least on the CL side. We can go ahead and check that box.

116
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.470
stokes: Well done, everyone.

117
00:17:50.870 --> 00:18:00.020
stokes: And then from there, essentially there's this period for non-headliners, and I think, you know, given where we're at,

118
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:08.530
stokes: we should probably focus, you know, more concretely on Amsterdam at the moment. So yeah, let me…

119
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.180
stokes: Think a bit about what I'd propose in terms of next steps there.

120
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:23.489
stokes: you know, for example, I'd rather us focus on, the ePBS DevNets, mentioning DevNets, before going through, like, a huge…

121
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.179
stokes: you know, set of, EIP proposals for Hegota.

122
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:35.669
stokes: Just given the relative timings of everything. But that all being said, yeah, I feel like we're making good progress with scoping.

123
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:41.340
stokes: And… then, yeah, we'll keep… keep all the wheels turning.

124
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.069
stokes: So… I think that's all I have for today.

125
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.729
stokes: I'm… yeah, okay, you can do that on Square.

126
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.449
stokes: Okay does anyone have anything else they'd like to bring up right now?

127
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:12.740
stokes: I think the main next thing was just, you know, as soon as we can get to ePBS DevNets.

128
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:21.550
stokes: then we can, I think, have more visibility into, yeah, thinking about scooping and timing of, yeah, both Glamsterdam and then also

129
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.630
stokes: Hegota, so…

130
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:36.149
stokes: Until we're there, I think we're just kind of in a holding pattern. But, yeah. After the call, well, sometime in the next day or two, I'll get up the PR for FOCIL.

131
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.930
stokes: As the headliner.

132
00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.870
stokes: And, yeah.

133
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.189
stokes: I think that's all I have, so unless someone else has something else…

134
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.519
stokes: This might be one of the short SCL calls.

135
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.199
stokes: Going once.

136
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.480
stokes: Going twice.

137
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:12.290
stokes: Okay, well, then thanks, everyone. Yeah, let's go ahead and wrap up, and I will see you all next time.

138
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.500
stokes: Thank you.

139
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.230
Justin Florentine (Besu): Dinosaurs!
