00:24:13	Marc Harvey-Hill:	could make the deadline the cutoff for making a PR to glamsterdam meta-eip, so don't need to wait for merge
00:24:36	Marc Harvey-Hill:	or making a draft Pr if you don't have a number yet
00:27:00	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I think we can say:
until 1 week from now to make PFI intent clear
until 2 weeks from now to have everything properly merged (EIP itself and PFI in Meta EIP)
00:28:06	Josh Davis:	There are 31 PFI’d EIPs
00:28:09	Pooja Ranjan:	We’re looking to add more editors to help merge PRs faster and keep the review queue moving.

00:32:58	Caspar Schwarz-Schilling:	Worth pointing out that there’s a lot of related EIPs, eg repricing, that maybe make it a bit easier to work through ~30 EIPs by themes / bundles

Perhaps; if there’s ‘spare time’ (which im also not convinced of), then it can go into refining glam EIPs/specs as we get deeper into impl

01:00:52	Ansgar Dietrichs:	my personal opinion is the other side from Carl - I feel a bit uncomfortable with a large rebasing like 1000x

I think particle gas / milligas is not actually that much overhead (your actual gas counter in the implementation is now 1000x more resolution, but any time the EVM asks, you round to the old resolution) and would just get rid of the backwards compatibility headache

01:11:39	potuz:	Maria, Carl, was the biggest point against a rebase the external tooling that will need changes? I didn't get why for example wallets would need to change at all.
01:11:59	potuz:	to me it was a nobrainer that rebase should have minimal impact
01:12:38	Carl Beekhuizen:	another thing to flag, I personally think we should not target an arbitrary MGas/s and rather anchor on an existing OPCODE/ reference point.

eg. I think it’d be better to aim to keep the 21kGas tx minimum than 200MGas/ second. the former is a more meaningful anchor for everyone imo
01:13:22	Marius van der Wijden:	Reacted to "another thing to f..." with 👍
01:13:41	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	im thinking neither rebasing nor fractional should be the solution. we should just do repricing of everything and keep the smallest unit as 1. of course, along side that we would raise the gas limit to align with the new prices. this is way less big of a hassle than the suggested approaches. the suggested approaches feel like over engineering
01:14:00	potuz:	Replying to "another thing to fla..."

I think this is trickier with regards to what I am pointing that the broadcast/execution part of the slot changes in Glamsterdam and therefore the relative OPCODE gas pricing should change IMO

if we reprice all opcodes and precompiles, Wouldnt those rounding errors completely disappear. for example, just use 30 instead of 3 and use 15 for something you want to price as 1.5. this way it is not a real rebase, but opcode and precompile repricing.

you can think of it as rebase, but without the big tooling and wallet associated changes around it. as they can just consider it as repricing
01:18:32	Carl Beekhuizen:	Replying to "Maria, Carl, was the..."

btw even with external rebasing, only 2339 transactions in Ethereum’s history ever that would either fail or have a different state-root

and then the gas limit goes up matching the new prices

external rebasing is literally asking the wallet to send 21M for a transfer? that I think will be a nightmare fork

yes, pretty much every opcode’s pricing will change under (separate) EIP-7904
01:20:40	Maria Silva:	Replying to "im thinking neither ..."

The errors I was showing is already with a reprice based on Jacek’s empirical numbers. What you are suggesting is a softer rebase (like 10x), while still incurring some rounding errors. So I think it get some UX complexities while keeping rounding errors
01:20:54	potuz:	Reacted to "yes, pretty much eve..." with 👍

01:22:27	Carl Beekhuizen:	Replying to "Maria, Carl, was the..."

Yes I wanted to bring this up, esp. with Solidity constants where I'm rather sure constants (like ERC20 token name) are indeed written to code instead of storage. So you cannot duplicate ERC20 contracts if you want a different token name

01:24:57	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "im thinking neither ..."

is a soft rebase just 10x everything instead of 1000x everything?

because you can’t only 10x the compute operations, otherwise they are too expensive relative to state access and calldata and so on
01:24:57	Carl Beekhuizen:	Replying to "im thinking neither ..."

And even outside of rounding errors. Say we set ADD to 1 gas, transaction minimum (21k) will still jump up a bunch

01:25:57	Carl Beekhuizen:	Replying to "Maria, Carl, was the..."

01:26:02	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "Maria, Carl, was the..."

01:27:04	ignacio:	Reg the current Binary Tree proposal, this means we need to change this https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7864#code. Apart from the point of not depending on `address`, might have some other implications reg the first 128 chunks that we store in the account stem. Prob we still would need to do that, and for other code chunk indexes switch to a tree address that only depends on code_hash and not account address. 

So this means that there will still be some duplication introduced despite we might not be chargining it in this EIP.
