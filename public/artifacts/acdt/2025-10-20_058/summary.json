      "summary": "The team discussed the release of Erigon 3.2.1, which includes bug fixes and is recommended for use on Hoodi due to fixing an issue with Aragon producing invalid blocks.

Parithosh clarified that this conversion feature will be available in the next one or two releases after the fork. Ameziane mentioned that Besu also has an optional release available. The team also briefly discussed enabling 60M gas on Hoodi, which Parithosh confirmed should already be at that level."

Parithosh provided updates on DevNet 2, noting that while most nodes are now healthy, there's still an unhealthy Netherland node that needs to be fixed before switching the network ID. The team also mentioned that Aragon wants to conduct tests on PostDevnet, and Stefan was asked for an update on block-level access lists, which was not provided in the transcript."
