00:23:47	Sam:	How are params names assigned? Would something like "erc7730:tokenPath" be a valid name?

How about format? Would an ordered array be better than a single string, where the wallet picks the first format it recognizes?
00:25:09	patrick:	A question of mine for later… feel free to ignore for now.

So ABIs aren’t enough because why? I don’t fully understand the logic there. Is it because we have to be sure the ABI is correct? Using your proposed solution is mainly just saying “this is the correct ABI for X contract, and here is how you read the parameters”… yes? 

Like if a malicious token had a “transfer(address to, uint256 amount)”, but it actually removed tokens from the  address to , your solution would have those developers would just update the  intent  field of the json. Do I have that right?

I think I talked myself into remembering why this proposal is good. But the “ABIs can’t be trusted” feels a little weak, just more like “ABIs are hard to read” feels more correct no?

00:31:00	lcastillo:	@Sam params are assigned in the function name itself, which is in the form of a human readable ABI, which makes parameters names unambiguous. A parameter path like "#.tokenPath" would be valid if tokanPath appears as a parameter name in the human readbale ABI

00:32:21	lcastillo:	For formats we never really found a use case in which multiple formats would make sense for a single parameter, but if we ever see this case it would be a possible addition
00:33:00	Sam:	Replying to "@Sam params are a..."

I'll continue on the discussion thread
00:34:17	lcastillo:	@patrick indeed the issue to solve is more ABI is insufficient to represent the data to the user, more than untrusted.
In fact 7730 itself doesn't solve the trust issue, a rogue contract could easily misrepresent its parameters. Which is why the governance topic with a way to audit 7730 files vs contract implementation is super important for us

This is https://gist.github.com/nailkhaf/d81c73327fefdb76fdad847035ddbc82#file-architecture-overview-md  

right ?
