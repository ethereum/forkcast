00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.620
Justin Florentine (Besu): Good morning, Knicks!

2
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.879
nixo: Morning, Justin, how's it going?

3
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.070
Justin Florentine (Besu): It's alright. There's a lot going on.

4
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.709
Justin Florentine (Besu): As usual.

5
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.350
nixo: No December for you, though, huh?

6
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.880
Justin Florentine (Besu): Sadly, no.

7
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.679
Justin Florentine (Besu): I just got back from a team offsite in Portugal, like, right before East Denver hit. I was…

8
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.799
Justin Florentine (Besu): A little too wiped out to go straight from one event to another.

9
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.200
nixo: Makes sense.

10
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.289
Justin Florentine (Besu): How's the turnout there?

11
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.370
nixo: I haven't gone yet.

12
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.679
Justin Florentine (Besu): Is this gonna get recorded and end up on YouTube?

13
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.130
nixo: Yes, it will.

14
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.890
Justin Florentine (Besu): God.

15
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.800
Justin Florentine (Besu): Thank you, Nex.

16
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.560
Jannik Luhn: No.

17
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.760
Justin Florentine (Besu): Hey, Annik.

18
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.770
Justin Florentine (Besu): Probably get started shortly.

19
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.109
Justin Florentine (Besu): Give people some time to filter in, since this is our first call.

20
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.400
Justin Florentine (Besu): We are being recorded, just FYI.

21
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:11.449
Justin Florentine (Besu): We are gonna ask the… AI to summarize the meeting, and the recording will be posted on YouTube.

22
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.410
Justin Florentine (Besu): Hey, Fabio Handers.

23
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.230
Fabio Di Fabio: Hi, everyone.

24
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.289
Justin Florentine (Besu): Take another minute to let people fill in, and then we'll get started.

25
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.139
Justin Florentine (Besu): Let's see, let's post the agenda. The agenda is a little bit…

26
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.609
Justin Florentine (Besu): Light, because it's our first meeting.

27
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.430
Justin Florentine (Besu): I'm gonna post it in the chat…

28
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.519
Justin Florentine (Besu): Cool. So, hey everybody, welcome to Encrypt the Mempool call number 0.

29
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:25.959
Justin Florentine (Besu): This is a kickoff call. We're going to encrypt the mempool. The question is how and when.

30
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.540
Justin Florentine (Besu): So… I think for starters…

31
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:37.979
Justin Florentine (Besu): Everybody here should already be well-versed in the designs, understand them. This is really more of a project management call.

32
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:51.500
Justin Florentine (Besu): does this time work for most people? Is this a recurring pain point for anybody? I think as long as we… we definitely need to have somebody from the 8105 folks, we definitely need to have somebody from the Lucid…

33
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:59.619
Justin Florentine (Besu): On each call, I think, until we, you know, stabilize those two EIPs.

34
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.610
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yannick, this sounds good to you? Okay, good.

35
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.449
Justin Florentine (Besu): I'm gonna make this work for me.

36
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.210
Justin Florentine (Besu): At the very least… Okay.

37
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.290
Justin Florentine (Besu): Good.

38
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:24.580
Justin Florentine (Besu): So I think for starters, maybe we can, I think, really, as we get started, we really want to have all eyes on stabilizing these EIPs.

39
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:39.030
Justin Florentine (Besu): It's the major first step that we need to hit. 8105 already has its EIP. Yannick, have you had changes, updates, new and interesting things that have happened on your EIP in the last week or so?

40
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:47.159
Jannik Luhn: Yes, we had. First of all, thanks for organizing the call, I think that's a great, great initiative, and…

41
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:59.069
Jannik Luhn: good to have, like, a regular space, to, to discuss this. For EIP, the update was, mostly what we've discussed earlier, the…

42
00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:17.559
Jannik Luhn: switch to a more explicit two-slot execution design. We do that by having now two transaction types, one encrypted and one decrypted. The encrypted transaction goes to the first block, and then corresponding… correspondingly, the decrypted transaction at the start of the next block.

43
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:27.339
Jannik Luhn: So that should be, should make it easier for, I think applications to implement this, because there's not less, like, cross, information that needs to be

44
00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:30.669
Jannik Luhn: Retrieve from a previous block for execution.

45
00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:35.909
Jannik Luhn: What we have not changed there is that the…

46
00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:55.729
Jannik Luhn: Execution context for transaction will still be the previous block, so the decrypted transaction will… if it tries to access, for example, the Coinbase address or the slot number, it will still refer to the previous block. This is so that the next builder cannot communicate with transactions after they've been included.

47
00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:16.469
Jannik Luhn: Yes, and one more thing we added there for the decrypted transaction that might be interesting for other proposals as well, I'm not sure, is that we added a reference to the envelope signer. So, basically, the decrypt transaction has to reference the encrypted transaction as a whole.

48
00:10:16.579 --> 00:10:30.409
Jannik Luhn: This is so that, to prevent what we call an envelope stripping attack, imagine that the transaction gets included, and the key gets published, but the key is published late, so it does not get executed.

49
00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:44.819
Jannik Luhn: But then everyone can decrypt the transaction and potentially resend it again, and then front-run it. And to prevent that, we require the transaction to at least reference the sign of the envelope, so that only this entity can do this attack.

50
00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:52.779
Jannik Luhn: And if they trust them, then this is prevented. So, yeah, I think these are the most important changes that we made to the proposal.

51
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.630
Justin Florentine (Besu): And these are all merged into… The EIP repository?

52
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.169
Jannik Luhn: They are pushed to the EIP repository, I'm not sure if they're merged yet.

53
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.800
Justin Florentine (Besu): I see, okay, I didn't see any open PRs… for them.

54
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.480
Justin Florentine (Besu): Wait.

55
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.200
Jannik Luhn: Oh my god.

56
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.439
Jannik Luhn: I'm willing and send it to the chat.

57
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.199
Justin Florentine (Besu): That'd be great, that'd be great, thank you.

58
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.569
Justin Florentine (Besu): Those are some significant changes, that's good.

59
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.429
Justin Florentine (Besu): I think we're gonna wanna review those and take a look at them.

60
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.309
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay, any questions for Yannick?

61
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.410
Justin Florentine (Besu): EIP-8105.

62
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:53.960
Justin Florentine (Besu): Remind me, Yannick, how, gas is reserved between the two slots, now that you have a two-slot design.

63
00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:03.200
Jannik Luhn: Yes, so that's also… by the way, I just looked it up, the PR has been merged, yesterday, including the new change.

64
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.640
Justin Florentine (Besu): It does have the new change. Great.

65
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.560
Jannik Luhn: Oh, sorry.

66
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:24.400
Jannik Luhn: Regarding gas, so we opted for basically making the encrypted transaction consume oil gas, and the decrypted transaction to consume no gas. And the idea there is that,

67
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.890
Jannik Luhn: The builder cannot sell block space of the next block.

68
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:36.130
Jannik Luhn: But we still want to preserve, kind of, the… on average, the block gas limit. So this,

69
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:54.369
Jannik Luhn: makes it possible for one block to use, more computation than is accounted for in gas, because if a decrypted transaction takes a long time to execute, then this… the transaction in which the decrypt… the block in which the decrypted transaction is included can… still has the normal amount of gas available.

70
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:09.029
Jannik Luhn: But this is only possible if the previous block was lighter in a way. So the block that included the encrypted transaction will have less computation while still paying for all the gas.

71
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.540
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay.

72
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:26.249
Justin Florentine (Besu): So this is… I think this is an interesting issue that both designs need to address, is that you are paying in block N for gas consumed in block N plus 1, and the base fee is likely going to change between them.

73
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:35.920
Justin Florentine (Besu): And so, in block N, we charge them the full limit. I assume you guys at 8105 would charge the full limit.

74
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.479
Justin Florentine (Besu): Specified on the encrypted transaction, is that right?

75
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.010
Jannik Luhn: Yes.

76
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:41.770
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay.

77
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.000
Justin Florentine (Besu): And…

78
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:53.420
Justin Florentine (Besu): I assume that it's bound to the decrypted transaction having the same gas limit, and so now the question becomes, like, okay, well…

79
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.639
Justin Florentine (Besu): Oh, what price do we charge them?

80
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:05.569
Justin Florentine (Besu): Because… We're… we're… we're giving them a future, essentially, on the gas.

81
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.790
Justin Florentine (Besu): That they're going to use in the next block, right?

82
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.029
Jannik Luhn: Yes, yeah, true.

83
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.769
Jannik Luhn: So that would be, in our case, the gas price of block N, the inclusion block.

84
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.140
Justin Florentine (Besu): Right.

85
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.870
Justin Florentine (Besu): Had anybody considered this, or have any suggestions on… on approaches?

86
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.350
Justin Florentine (Besu): You know, we could do things like just give it, like, a fixed markup.

87
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:38.049
Justin Florentine (Besu): Where we say, if you're going to reserve the next block's gas, it's gonna be, you know, 10% more, 12% more, or something like that.

88
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:47.990
Justin Florentine (Besu): We could… Calculate it, since we should know what the base fee will move to.

89
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.110
Justin Florentine (Besu): In the block.

90
00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.339
Justin Florentine (Besu): We could charge it that way.

91
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:59.770
Justin Florentine (Besu): It will complicate… gas metering, and EL clients.

92
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:10.270
Justin Florentine (Besu): And, let's see, another way that we could do it would be, like, well, a fixed overhead, right? Where we say, like, this gas costs…

93
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:17.770
Justin Florentine (Besu): X more… Where X is going to be greater than the possible change in the base fee.

94
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:23.049
Justin Florentine (Besu): And we say that that's just the cost of using the feature.

95
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:29.040
Justin Florentine (Besu): And then the question is, is like, okay, do you burn the difference, I would assume?

96
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.979
Justin Florentine (Besu): It burns the same way.

97
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.410
Justin Florentine (Besu): The execution gas does.

98
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:35.640
Justin Florentine (Besu): So…

99
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:50.839
Jannik Luhn: Do we know if this is valuable? Like, would people actually want to pay more for future gas, or is it, I mean, on average, I would guess it will cancel out, because, like, gas price will rise and fall randomly.

100
00:15:52.320 --> 00:16:00.649
Jannik Luhn: So maybe we can just, if that's, like, not abusable, or not likely to be abused, maybe for simplicity, we can just,

101
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.700
Jannik Luhn: Use the, the, yeah, inclusion gas price.

102
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.750
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, so, actually, the thing is that,

103
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:22.769
Anders Elowsson: It's not random in a way, because the builder will know how much gas it uses, so the builder will know how much the price in the next block is going to be.

104
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:29.300
Anders Elowsson: For the transactions. But the thing is that the builder decides who gets in and who gets out.

105
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.550
Anders Elowsson: And so there's, like, no reason why, for example, if they're very…

106
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:45.270
Anders Elowsson: if the block is full, then… then the… the transaction that goes in in block N would benefit from the,

107
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:54.279
Anders Elowsson: paying for… in block N instead of block N plus 1. But… but the thing is that, it's sort of,

108
00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:09.110
Anders Elowsson: The builder can always include a regular… it's not like an incentive to push your regular transaction into sealed transactions to pay less, in a way, because the builder can always…

109
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.890
Anders Elowsson: Put in your regular transaction anyway in the block.

110
00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:25.199
Anders Elowsson: So there's not super dangerous incentives, as far as I can tell, if you're short for block N.

111
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.530
Anders Elowsson: the base fee at plugin.

112
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.900
Jannik Luhn: Interesting, so it's basically, the builder could, yep.

113
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:46.130
Jannik Luhn: Basically, yeah, the question is how much gas will be used for encrypted transactions or serial transactions, and how much for regular transactions.

114
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.880
Jannik Luhn: And, you know.

115
00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:04.829
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, so we have a… in this design, we have a limit for how much gas you can…

116
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.519
Anders Elowsson: Occupy top of block of the next block.

117
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:17.329
Anders Elowsson: So we… in the research post, it was a quarter, one-fourth, but now in the AP, it's currently specified to 1 eighth.

118
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:31.249
Jannik Luhn: Are there similar questions for pure fossil as well? Because that's always a bit strange for me, that.

119
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:47.550
Jannik Luhn: Basically, you can force a… yeah, you don't pay the includeers in this case, so you can get transactions in even if the builder doesn't want to, so you're kind of selling the builder's block space,

120
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.120
Jannik Luhn: I don't know, it seems to me that there might… Potentially be similar questions?

121
00:18:54.870 --> 00:19:14.790
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, in fossil, you are not restricted in terms of gas, because it's a conditional design, and what this means is that you can have a fossil transaction that takes up all the gas, because you can make some sort of weird transaction where you just loop-loop over a for loop and write state, for example.

122
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:31.520
Anders Elowsson: But the thing is that you are limited in terms of the size of the transactions, and if you aggregate the sizes of the transactions that can be included via inclusion list, you are still limited to around…

123
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.029
Anders Elowsson: 16 times 8 kilobytes.

124
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:45.680
Anders Elowsson: But anyway, the builder will know, at the time it bids for the block, it will know how much, how much…

125
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.140
Justin Florentine (Besu): How much limiting?

126
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.690
Anders Elowsson: This… how much they are limited.

127
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.129
Anders Elowsson: So if they are very limited, then they will not bid so much, maybe, maybe.

128
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:58.630
Jannik Luhn: Okay.

129
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:07.150
Jannik Luhn: Yeah, I guess adding a limit in 8.105 should also be, like, Relatively straightforward.

130
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:15.029
Jannik Luhn: We had a limit as well for… in… our, NOSIS chain implementation.

131
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:21.650
Jannik Luhn: But that was just for security, so that, in case there's some abuse happening, that we don't…

132
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.950
Jannik Luhn: Use the whole block space for that.

133
00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.799
Jannik Luhn: Yeah, so I guess that's not really relevant.

134
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:49.440
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, so in the Lucid design, the limit fills another purpose, which is that we guarantee that once you are in a beacon block, you will get,

135
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:59.629
Anders Elowsson: Executed, even if the next payload is missing, but we then want to push two payloads in a row with the…

136
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:11.510
Anders Elowsson: With, sealed transactions. They're the ones from the missing, that were… that were committed to in the beacon block, and the ones for the previous one.

137
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.240
Anders Elowsson: And so, we at least need space for, for…

138
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:22.699
Anders Elowsson: For twice as many sealed transactions as the… That's the limit we set.

139
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.030
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay.

140
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.730
Justin Florentine (Besu): So it sounds like we still have a little bit of thinking to do on the motor?

141
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.430
Jannik Luhn: Yeah, we can, like, we're going to…

142
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:05.349
Jannik Luhn: Have another look at our proposal and see if we need to make updates there, and compare with Lucid.

143
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.060
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay.

144
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.470
Justin Florentine (Besu): Alright, any other, discussion points that folks would like to bring up?

145
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.740
Justin Florentine (Besu): This is kind of the open questions for the floor, section of the meeting.

146
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:34.560
Justin Florentine (Besu): Unless, Andrews, did you have anything that you wanted to say more broadly about Lucid with regard to status?

147
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.169
Anders Elowsson: Not really, we're… we're, we're, we're…

148
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.610
Anders Elowsson: We're working on the IP. I think it will take a few more days.

149
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.250
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yep.

150
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.340
Anders Elowsson: Do we get something up?

151
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.850
Justin Florentine (Besu): Agreed. Cool.

152
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.309
Jannik Luhn: I have maybe one, question.

153
00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:01.649
Jannik Luhn: that I've been thinking about, basically, I'm wondering if people have, done this already?

154
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:14.200
Jannik Luhn: So, we could look into real-world data, we could look at existing blocks, and see… check out the transactions that went through private mempools.

155
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:24.609
Jannik Luhn: And then see if we shuffle them randomly, if they still use the same amount of gas and lead to roughly the same execution results.

156
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:44.200
Jannik Luhn: Because if that's not the case, then, that would be maybe a reason that people would not want to use an encrypted mempool, because they don't have, like, specific ordering guarantees. That would mean they want to use private mempools, because they get, like, better, execution quality, basically.

157
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:50.900
Jannik Luhn: Another, thing that we could check there is if,

158
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.200
Jannik Luhn: I forgot, I had one, other reason for that.

159
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:19.840
Jannik Luhn: But basically, yeah, did people… do we know if some people did research there, check into, check out how existing… oh, yeah, yeah, basically, the, the key withholding in order to front-run attack. Basically, keep the order as is, add other… and try to simulate front-running attacks,

160
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.099
Jannik Luhn: Yeah, and see how much gas that would use, and how much profit it would yield.

161
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.290
Jannik Luhn: That would…

162
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:35.929
Jannik Luhn: At least far, it's interesting to see if the… because then we will know if the trust graph is required and helpful or not.

163
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.239
Jannik Luhn: So I'm wondering if people have looked into this already, or if, if not.

164
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:48.430
Justin Florentine (Besu): I have not, and I have not heard of anybody looking into that.

165
00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:14.990
Jannik Luhn: Okay, because then I think it would… I'm not sure how much time we have for that, like, on our side, how much resources, but at least the first thing, just looking into out blocks and shuffling the transaction and see if the outcome is still similar, I think that's, like, relatively easy to do, so we might try that, and if we do that, we're going to…

166
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.399
Jannik Luhn: reported here, I guess.

167
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:26.730
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay. Alright, so this is maybe a call to action for anybody that thinks that they could help with this,

168
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:34.149
Justin Florentine (Besu): We would be looking for analysts or, maybe map searchers that are willing to help.

169
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.049
Justin Florentine (Besu): To provide some data and run these simulations.

170
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:48.680
Justin Florentine (Besu): So if everybody could kind of reach out to your personal networks to see if there's anybody that would be interested in helping, please send them ENXY.

171
00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:02.519
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, it sounds like… Bundle detection is kind of what you're looking for, right?

172
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.940
Justin Florentine (Besu): Because the trust graph of the release

173
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:14.170
Justin Florentine (Besu): keys, or the key providers, rather, in 8105.

174
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.710
Justin Florentine (Besu): May require those bundles to be preserved.

175
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:30.129
Jannik Luhn: I'm not sure… so the bundle detection, I think, would be interesting, just for,

176
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:41.550
Jannik Luhn: So if a transaction's in a bundle, then it probably requires a specific order with other transactions, and I think then this is just not viable for,

177
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.249
Jannik Luhn: Yeah, for the public encrypted mempool designs that we've been discussing so far.

178
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:52.479
Jannik Luhn: Because there you don't have… you don't express an order requirement there.

179
00:26:54.730 --> 00:27:03.629
Jannik Luhn: But yeah, that would be, I guess, an interesting… like, if there are lots of these bundles, then it's potentially problematic.

180
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:14.699
Justin Florentine (Besu): We should… we should write this problem down and outline it maybe a little bit more clearly, give it a name.

181
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:25.350
Justin Florentine (Besu): I kind of see what you're saying here, but I don't know that I could verbalize it correctly to somebody that could actually answer it.

182
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.420
Anders Elowsson: I guess.

183
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.730
Jannik Luhn: Like you mentioned that.

184
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:47.530
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, I can mention that, we, we discussed with, there was Dot Always from Flashbots, who had a comment on our headliner proposal.

185
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:52.630
Anders Elowsson: And we discussed the issue of,

186
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.490
Anders Elowsson: Of, of, of, they, they, they have this, this,

187
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:09.180
Anders Elowsson: This… this functionality where they… they do these, order flow auctions.

188
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.530
Anders Elowsson: And,

189
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:22.810
Anders Elowsson: he mentioned the requirement of being able to bundle transactions, and in a response there, I talk about the fact that you can do this bundling in a…

190
00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:31.490
Anders Elowsson: in a non-guaranteed way, but you can do it in Lucid, because you set the top of block the same for all your transactions.

191
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:41.550
Anders Elowsson: Or with an increment of one way, and then you will be pretty much guaranteed that the transactions will be executed in this order that you specify.

192
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.810
Anders Elowsson: But it's also possible to, to enshrine that

193
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.589
Anders Elowsson: An order from the same decor.

194
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:53.210
Anders Elowsson: Or as key provider in ATA1 certifying.

195
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.310
Anders Elowsson: Would be, would have the same…

196
00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.420
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, but to have retained order.

197
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.759
Justin Florentine (Besu): To me, that feels like something that we could add on later. Do you…

198
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:16.010
Justin Florentine (Besu): Do you concur with that? Do you see that as… Necessary for… a minimal design.

199
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:31.210
Anders Elowsson: No, I'm just saying that… no, you're saying that right now you even have it. You have it already right now in the minimum viable EUP, but it's not guaranteed. Because if you, by chance, set the same, exact same way, top of book fee as some other, then you don't have it.

200
00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:37.430
Justin Florentine (Besu): You don't have a way to determine that, yeah, yeah. What I'm talking about is making it… deterministic.

201
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:39.950
Anders Elowsson: Exactly.

202
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.090
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay.

203
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:05.680
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay, then let's… we'll… we'll research this bundle issue a little bit better for our next meeting.

204
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.140
Justin Florentine (Besu): To discuss. We've got 5 minutes left, I want to be mindful of time.

205
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.330
Justin Florentine (Besu): Anything else folks want to discuss?

206
00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:27.150
Justin Florentine (Besu): Anything folks think they're gonna wanna discuss at our next call?

207
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.349
Justin Florentine (Besu): Possible agenda items.

208
00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.390
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay.

209
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.620
Justin Florentine (Besu): Then, sounds like we keep grinding on our EIPs.

210
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.319
Justin Florentine (Besu): Stay in touch on Telegram.

211
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.709
Justin Florentine (Besu): And encrypt the mempool.

212
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:11.330
Jannik Luhn: For topics for next week, or next call in two weeks, I guess, are we going to have a GitHub issue, where we can post them if things come up?

213
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.699
Justin Florentine (Besu): Absolutely, I can open one, I can open one immediately.

214
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.990
Jannik Luhn: Perfect.

215
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.449
Justin Florentine (Besu): Alright, thanks everyone.

216
00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.199
Justin Florentine (Besu): See you on the internet.

217
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.330
Anders Elowsson: Thanks.

218
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.170
Kevaundray Wedderburn: Yeah.

219
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:33.760
Fabio Di Fabio: Right, bye.
