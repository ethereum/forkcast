      "label": "ePBS Beta Release and Testing",
      "summary": "Justin announced a new specs release beta.0 with updates for ePBS. Terence discussed open testing PRs for ePBS, mentioning that the only one not yet addressed is process withdraw, which he is hesitant to work on due to its complexity. He expressed a willingness to continue working on it but invited others to take it up if they wish. Terence also highlighted the importance of ForkChoice Pass testing, noting its relevance to edge cases involving anti-slot and PTC status. He requested feedback from experts like Mikael and Roberto on the edge cases he had previously shared."

    {
      "label": "DevNet Zero Implementation Progress",
      "summary": "The team discussed implementation progress for DevNet Zero, with Terence reporting on PR reviews and Stefan noting completion of containers and reference tests. NFLaig shared updates on BPS changes and container work for Lodestar, while Subhasish reported progress on beacon chain changes and state transition functions. The team agreed to provide an ePBS-devnet-0 branch by the end of October, and Stefan clarified that DataComs in Teku currently uses a slot field, which is not an immediate issue for DevNet0."

    {
      "label": "KCG Commitments Implementation Discussion",
      "summary": "The team discussed concerns about the implementation of KCG commitments in Fuloop, noting that accessing commitments from the beacon block may not work with ePBS. Potuz raised a notice about keeping the latest execution payload header in the beacon state, explaining that the current solution reuses the position due to circular dependencies. The team also addressed a potential issue with SSZ fork-choice container in static tests, which Justin agreed to investigate. The conversation ended with the team merging to develop and agreeing to meet again in two weeks."
