00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.140
Pooja Ranjan: Hello, Justin.

2
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.390
Justin Traglia: Hey, Pooja, how's it going?

3
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.430
Pooja Ranjan: Doing well, thank you. Justin, I'm assuming you are gonna run the, Call today.

4
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.669
Justin Traglia: I am, and for the future as well.

5
00:02:44.900 --> 00:03:00.750
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, awesome. I may not be able to continue for the whole of the call, like, towards the end of the call, so Akash from ECH Team will be here, so let him know whenever you're ready to stream over, and he would be taking care of streaming today.

6
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.920
Justin Traglia: Okay, sounds good, thank you.

7
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.760
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you.

8
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.180
Justin Traglia: Would it be okay if I started to share my screen right now?

9
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.810
Justin Traglia: What's the agenda?

10
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.849
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, sure.

11
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.299
Pooja Ranjan: Akash, can you please make the pre-stream started so we can confirm?

12
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.860
Akash | ECH: Yep. EPA online.

13
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.239
Akash | ECH: That's pretty extreme.

14
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.250
Pooja Ranjan: Cool.

15
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.799
Justin Traglia: Cool. Thank you.

16
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.839
Justin Traglia: Hello, those who just joined, just a few more minutes.

17
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.449
Justin Traglia: Good morning, good morning. Just a couple more minutes.

18
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.690
Justin Traglia: Good morning, Terrence.

19
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.970
terence: Good morning.

20
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.730
Justin Traglia: One…

21
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.760
terence: Just a day.

22
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.170
Justin Traglia: started.

23
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.710
terence: He'll be 5 minutes late.

24
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.940
terence: But we can start… okay.

25
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.289
Justin Traglia: Sounds good.

26
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.230
Justin Traglia: Good morning, Stephan.

27
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.200
Stefan Bratanov: Thanks.

28
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.519
Justin Traglia: Alright, Akash, could you start the stream?

29
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.840
Akash | ECH: Yeah, VLA.

30
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.620
Justin Traglia: Great, thank you.

31
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.830
Justin Traglia: Hi everyone. Welcome to EPBS Breakout Call 24.

32
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.330
Justin Traglia: Let me share the agenda in the chat real quick.

33
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.240
Justin Traglia: Just shared.

34
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:14.769
Justin Traglia: I think I'd like to start by announcing that there is a new, specs release, spec release, Beta.0, which has a bunch of updates for EPBS.

35
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:24.060
Justin Traglia: In the agenda, I've listed open PRs and merged PRs. Many of the merged PRs are included in this release.

36
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:35.509
Justin Traglia: Terrence, would you like to go over some of the open, testing PRs that you have for EPBS, and, like, what the status is of those?

37
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:44.959
terence: Yeah, so, I think the only one we don't have in block operation is process withdraw.

38
00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:53.479
terence: And frankly, I was a bit hesitant to work on it a couple weeks ago because of… I wasn't sure if there would be changes or…

39
00:08:53.479 --> 00:09:12.659
terence: on the, yet expected withdrawal function, and that function is pretty convoluted. Right now, there, there's a four, there's three, four, there's three, for loops within the same function, so I wasn't sure if there's gonna be any refactorial changes to that, but sounds like there's gonna be no change to that. Francesco mentioned that.

40
00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:20.519
terence: And, so I can continue working on it, or anyone is willing to free to pick this up. It's a really…

41
00:09:20.609 --> 00:09:24.499
terence: difficult unit tests to write. I have to be very careful.

42
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:31.719
terence: Given all the conditions, because there is, because besides builder withdrawal, there's also partial withdrawal.

43
00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:45.949
terence: And then there's process withdraw right after. So there's edge cases you can think of, like, what happens if the balance run out, blah blah blah blah blah, right? So, yeah, I'm happy to continue working on it, but anyone more than free to pick this up.

44
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:49.609
terence: And 4 Choice Pass is another one that's,

45
00:09:49.769 --> 00:10:05.349
terence: I wouldn't say it's low priority, but, like, I'd rather focus on prism work, implementation for DeathNet Zero than the for-sure test, but that's not some… but that's something that we should not neglect. It's also very important, given the…

46
00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:17.889
terence: edge cases, that's because of… now you have this notion of anti-slaw. So, when a… when a proposal builds on the previous block.

47
00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:33.249
terence: when a proposal builds on the head, there is, like, this option of, like, what is the root and what is the block hash, basically. And that's… and that also makes for choice tests a little tricky. You also have to consider the PTC status as well.

48
00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:45.569
terence: And, yeah, so I have… last time I made sure I have a HackMD, I also shared that with all the edge cases. I want feedback, but I haven't gotten the feedback. And that's something that I think, like,

49
00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:55.979
terence: Definitely, like, Mikel or, like, Roberto from the EF to also take a look as well, because they are the experts on that, yeah. So those are the two open ones.

50
00:10:56.109 --> 00:11:01.959
terence: Yeah, and but right now, I'm focusing mostly on Prism Definite Zero work.

51
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:13.039
Justin Traglia: Oh, cool. Yeah, I forgot about the refactoring of process withdrawals. I'll need to talk with Stokes about whether or not he wants to do that soon, sooner or later.

52
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:22.290
Justin Traglia: And, I agree that focusing on PRISM implementation for DevNet Zero is probably a higher priority than the fork choice test at the moment.

53
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.629
Justin Traglia: Cool, thank you. And I guess this leads well into implementation updates from clients.

54
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.760
Justin Traglia: Terrence, again, at… what are the… what's the status?

55
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:56.829
terence: Yeah, so I'm just implementing Definite Zero. I have, like, a few PRs out, the porters need to review that, and, yeah, so, I mean, I don't know if we're on track, it's kind of too early to tell for our end of October, but, yeah, we're definitely working very hard to get there. So, yeah, so we're implementing everything that's Beta Zero right now.

56
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:03.319
terence: And, yeah, I think in two weeks we'll… I think in two weeks, we'll have a better idea of where we are.

57
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.549
Justin Traglia: Awesome, thank you.

58
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.929
Justin Traglia: I don't think there's anyone from Lighthouse here, is there?

59
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.039
Justin Traglia: Alright, in that case, Techyu, Stefan, what's the… do you have any status updates for your.

60
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:26.150
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, sure. So… Yeah, we've done all the containers for Beta Zero.

61
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:32.149
Stefan Bratanov: And, most of the blog posting is done.

62
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:37.130
Stefan Bratanov: Passing the reference tests, most of them,

63
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.949
Stefan Bratanov: But yeah, there's still quite a lot of work, so…

64
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.160
Stefan Bratanov: In… I think in two weeks also, we'll have, more updates.

65
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.410
Stefan Bratanov: Hopefully.

66
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.969
Justin Traglia: Cool. Thank you.

67
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.140
Justin Traglia: I don't think there's anyone from Nimbus here.

68
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.449
Justin Traglia: So Lodestar, Anka?

69
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:10.439
nflaig: We did a bunch of preparations, mostly, like, got the BPS changes done, was quite a big refactoring,

70
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:19.670
nflaig: In terms of EPBS stuff, we did the containers, what else? All the constants, a lot of boiler blading.

71
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.400
nflaig: I'm not sure if NC has more updates.

72
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.570
NC: No, I'm just fixing up, some of the types, in the lowest star code base.

73
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.270
NC: But yeah, it's still pretty early for us.

74
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.060
Justin Traglia: Okay. Yep, that seems… that's fine.

75
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:47.170
Justin Traglia: And then, I guess Grantine, do you guys have any status updates?

76
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.839
Justin Traglia: For your implementation?

77
00:13:49.480 --> 00:14:06.489
Subhasish | Grandine(EPF): Yeah, so, mostly, the changes have been made, related to a beacon chain, so, I have, I've worked on, the, implementing the containers, and then the helper function, functions related to it.

78
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:13.960
Subhasish | Grandine(EPF): Apart from that, I'm, making some progress related to, the state transition functions.

79
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:25.130
Subhasish | Grandine(EPF): I think, the particular, one that was taken out of process block was giving a bit of trouble, but, yeah. And, we're,

80
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:40.669
Subhasish | Grandine(EPF): We're looking forward to, making sense of the folk choice changes, because, it's, our own implementation is, a bit different from others, so, yeah, we're working on that.

81
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.749
Justin Traglia: Great, great, thank you.

82
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:54.799
Justin Traglia: Yeah, I think the next two weeks will be… or in two weeks will be further along, and it'll be more interesting. And, welcome, POTUS, no worries about being late.

83
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:07.490
Justin Traglia: Next up on the agenda is just to reiterate… reiterate plans for EPMS DevNet Zero. It will be based on the Beta Zero specifications, and I've added a note here.

84
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:19.289
Justin Traglia: from Barnabas to, provide an ePBS-devnet-0 branch for ETH PandaOps, whenever you can, but preferably by the end of October.

85
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.250
Justin Traglia: Okay, moving on one more time,

86
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:35.969
Justin Traglia: There was a question in the EPBS Discord from Stefan about whether or not Datacom's headcar needed a slot field. Are there any updates on that?

87
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:49.720
Stefan Bratanov: Not really, it was just an observation, so in Datacom's sidecar object, in TechCo, we have a get slot, which basically gets the slot from the header right now, and it's used in

88
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.229
Stefan Bratanov: Quite a few places.

89
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:57.150
Stefan Bratanov: around tests and other places, so I'm not sure what the impact is yet for us,

90
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:05.029
Stefan Bratanov: But I think for now, it's okay to just ignore that and probably come back to it later. I think for DevNet0,

91
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.790
Stefan Bratanov: We're gonna run without any blobs anyways, so…

92
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.430
Stefan Bratanov: No, not a big issue for now.

93
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.710
Justin Traglia: Okay. Potus.

94
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:22.289
Potuz: Yeah, actually, something that I raised a long time ago, but we still haven't had time to look into.

95
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:33.219
Potuz: I'm worried about the code from Fulu. When we designed the PBS, and when we implemented it, it was on top of Electra. And in Fusaka, the…

96
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:40.690
Potuz: I mean, we have all of these blobs that… with the KCG commitments, that are coming in the block.

97
00:16:40.890 --> 00:17:00.730
Potuz: And the KCG commitments are no longer coming from the block… in the block. In the spec, this is not a problem, because we never need to access them. But in implementation, it seems to me… I looked briefly in PRISM, and it seems to me that it's very insidious, the fact that we look for the KCG commitments in the PICOM block.

98
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:09.799
Potuz: And this is not going to work on EPBS, so I suspect that this is also going to be a big pain when trying to rebase,

99
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.440
Potuz: EPBS on top of Fuloop.

100
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.840
Stefan Bratanov: Oh yeah, for sure.

101
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.980
Stefan Bratanov: I think we've had the same…

102
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:25.439
Stefan Bratanov: issue. I mean, not an issue, but I remember when I did the EPBS interrupt for Teco, I changed it a lot of places.

103
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.049
Stefan Bratanov: To… Get it from the envelope rather than the block.

104
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:44.439
Potuz: Right, we could do this for blobs on Electra, because we already had it on Develop, but then all of the Fusaka branch, all of the Fusaka implementation was being carried in a different branch, which now merged into Develop.

105
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:58.690
Potuz: And changing all of that to get… to take the ACG commitments out of the block, I don't know how bad that's gonna be. Terrence probably has already worked that out, so I'm probably talking out of an empty statement. Perhaps Terrence already solved this.

106
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.299
Justin Traglia: Terrence says, haven't solved it yet.

107
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.639
Justin Traglia: Okay, interesting, we can follow up on that.

108
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:28.490
Justin Traglia: Okay, anything else about the data column sidecar, structure? I guess we can figure this out, if it's… if it's necessary to have the slot field and include that in the next release, and then for the next DevNet.

109
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.380
Justin Traglia: If necessary.

110
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:40.080
Justin Traglia: Okay, I guess there's one other item on the agenda, which is a note from POTUS about

111
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.159
Justin Traglia: The fact that it's impossible to keep latest execution payload header in the beacon state.

112
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.150
Justin Traglia: Just a reminder.

113
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.069
Justin Traglia: And POTUS, do you want to talk any… any more about that?

114
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:58.599
Potuz: This is just a notice for people that are implementing, if you're looking at this, the… well, the latest release already has this. It's a… it was a PR by Francesco.

115
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:18.189
Potuz: We had this discussion with 3 different options. Rename only the latest payload header to being latest payload bid. Then there was an option that Terrence implemented that was move the payload bid as a new member, and make the payload header empty.

116
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:37.330
Potuz: And then there was this other one that was trying to keep the payload header with all of the information, because having an empty one didn't make any sense, and I agree. We… everyone agreed that having an empty one didn't make any sense, so we say, okay, let's… last time we had a breakout, we agreed on keeping the full payload header, but it's still

117
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:56.149
Potuz: That was a stupid decision, because, the payload header commits to the root, to the stage root, which cannot be known before, so there's a circle… a circular dependency there, so we cannot really have the latest payload header with the current functionality.

118
00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:02.179
Potuz: Therefore, the only two options are having an empty one, or just

119
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:21.569
Potuz: reusing the position, and we decided to just reuse the position. So this is more or less… this is more a heads up for Lodestar, because Lodestar complained about removing fields. This is changing the payload header by a different one, which is the bid. If this is too much of a problem to Lodestar, we can see what to do.

120
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.779
Justin Traglia: Cool, thank you. And, NC, thumbs up.

121
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:36.769
Justin Traglia: I guess that's it for the agenda. Is there anything else that anyone else would want to talk about?

122
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.050
Potuz: There was a comment today about SSN.

123
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.540
Potuz: I think it was also NC?

124
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:54.569
NC: Yeah, I was just trying to run, the Beta Zeros, as a Z static test.

125
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.930
NC: So,

126
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:05.929
NC: I saw there is a, fork choice node, container in the static test. I'm not sure if that's intentional.

127
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.010
Justin Traglia: Probably not.

128
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.270
Justin Traglia: But I can double check.

129
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:25.499
Potuz: Yeah, it was a good catch. I think it's probably… we need to remove it now. The only place where I can see it might be useful to have it as an SSS object is in the Beacon API when we dumped the fork choice.

130
00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.139
Potuz: But currently, that's not even specified, so…

131
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.639
Justin Traglia: Yeah, we can… I think we can convert it to a data class.

132
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.150
Justin Traglia: So that it's not a SSC object.

133
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.900
Justin Traglia: I can look into it.

134
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.300
Justin Traglia: Anything else?

135
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.850
Justin Traglia: From anyone?

136
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.420
Potuz: The race is on, we already are merging to develop.

137
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.590
Justin Traglia: Yeah, absolutely.

138
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.429
Potuz: Now we need to… we're racing to see who implements first.

139
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.220
Justin Traglia: Yep, yep.

140
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.740
Stefan Bratanov: Is there a price, or…

141
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.100
Justin Traglia: Bragging rights.

142
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.320
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, fair enough.

143
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.620
Stefan Bratanov: Twitter post.

144
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.109
Justin Traglia: Ha, yes.

145
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.509
Justin Traglia: Okay, I'll let you guys get back to developing then.

146
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.400
Justin Traglia: I'll talk to you guys in 2 weeks.

147
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.520
terence: Thank you!

148
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.240
Justin Traglia: Hi, everyone.

149
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.430
Potuz: Thank you, guys, I'm sorry for being so late.

150
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.980
NC: Thank you guys.

151
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.530
Justin Traglia: fine.

152
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.620
nflaig: Yeah.
