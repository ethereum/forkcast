00:19:12	terence:	same
00:21:00	NC:	I think renaming is fine, but I probably wouldnâ€™t implement this in Lodestar. So internally (in Lodestarâ€™s codebase) it would still be  index  and not  payload_status , and probably wrap it as  payload_status  when dealing with beacon apis
00:23:40	potuz:	renaming still deals with JSON changes on the API and a bunch of other boilerplate that is kinda of a nightmare
00:24:32	kev:	Would changing it lead to less bugs in the future?
00:25:42	Barnabas:	+1 mark but Iâ€™m not a client dev
