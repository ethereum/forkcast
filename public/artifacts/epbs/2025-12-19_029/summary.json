  "summary_overview": "The meeting began with technical discussions about Zoom permissions and authentication issues, followed by updates from various client teams including PRISM, Lighthouse, and Teku regarding their development progress and merge requests. The team then explored several technical topics including builder API endpoints, proposer preferences, and block import workflows, with particular focus on anti-DOS mechanisms and the potential separation of builders from validators in Ethereum's consensus mechanism. The conversation ended with discussions about non-validator builders and their implications, including concerns about state bloat and index reuse, along with review of pending PRs and specifications for builder API integration.",
  "summary_details": [
    {
      "label": "Client Team Progress Updates",
      "summary": "The meeting focused on updates from various client teams. Terence reported that PRISM is waiting for the PR for the state builder to be merged, which will allow further progress. Shane shared that Lighthouse has merged the containers branch into their unstable branch and is working on fork-choice-related changes and payload separations. Enrico provided an update on Teku, mentioning ongoing work on gossip validation and payload attestation. The meeting also discussed the transition of EPBS discussions to ACDT starting in 2026."
    },
    {
      "label": "Validator and Builder API Updates",
      "summary": "The team discussed several topics including builder API endpoints, proposer preferences, and block import workflows. Nico explained the block import flow involving consensus blocks and intermediate beacon states. Caleb reported on integrating payload attestation to validator duties and work on fork-choice mechanisms. The team debated the necessity of implementing builder API endpoints on beacon nodes, with Nico and others expressing doubt about its practicality for solo stakers. Justin presented a PR on proposer preferences, which allows validators and proposers to share peer recipient and gas-limit preferences to builders before proposal slots, and received support from Nico."
    },
    {
      "label": "Protocol and Bid Threshold Discussion",
      "summary": "The team discussed two main topics: a protocol completion and a bid forwarding threshold. For the protocol, they agreed to wait until the next epoch before allowing builders to submit bids, rather than implementing a more complex system to handle preference distribution. Justin shared a PR in the chat regarding a bid forwarding threshold, which would help prevent DOS attacks by requiring new bids to be a certain percentage (e.g., 3%) more valuable than the previous highest bid. The team was asked for their opinions on this proposal, particularly from builders and Lorenzo."
    },
    {
      "label": "Anti-DOS Bidding Increment Discussion",
      "summary": "The team discussed a proposed 3% bidding increment for an anti-DOS mechanism, with Lorenzo expressing concerns about its high value but acknowledging its potential as a fallback option. The group agreed that while the exact number might not be ideal, it could be adjusted later if needed, and terence suggested starting with a reasonable number and increasing it if DOS issues arise. Justin then introduced the topic of non-validator builders, explaining that they prefer faster deposits and smaller staking requirements, leading to a PR that was generally well-received by the team."
    },
    {
      "label": "Ethereum Builder-Validator Separation Discussion",
      "summary": "The team discussed the implications of separating builders from validators in Ethereum's consensus mechanism. They debated the technical and security aspects of allowing anyone to become a builder by depositing 1 ETH, with concerns raised about state bloat and index reuse. The group also reviewed open questions on a PR, including whether builders should use withdrawal requests or voluntary exits, and discussed the potential need for a withdrawable epoch field for builders. Bharath mentioned that initial builder API specs were ready for review after the stake builder's PR is merged."
