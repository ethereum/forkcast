  "summary_overview": "The team discussed development updates, focusing on rebase efforts and client integrations. Jihoon noted that feature specs were hidden but will have a separate section from canonical ones. Pelle reported progress on the first EIP interrupt between Rath and Gath, and Katya added new metrics but plans to discuss further next week. The team addressed issues with running Lodestar on top of Ethereum, with Katya and Jihoon agreeing to investigate further. They also confirmed that the latest client images are available in Jihoon's repository, with the old version recommended for Lodestar testing. The conversation ended with an acknowledgment of team members being busy with EIPs and Fusica, and the next meeting was scheduled for two weeks.",
