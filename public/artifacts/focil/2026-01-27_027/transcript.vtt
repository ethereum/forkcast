00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:16.140
Jihoon: then we can claim that, oh, yeah, we'll help build the prototype so that it clears out those unknowns. Hello guys, I'm here with you 3 more minutes. I'm sorry to have this, then I think that…

2
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.710
Jihoon: Alright, nearly 5 minutes in, so I think we can start.

3
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.140
Jihoon: Can you guys hear me okay?

4
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:42.039
Jihoon: Okay, cool. Okay, hello everyone, welcome to Fossil Breakout 27. I think today's breakout call will be nice and short, nice and short.

5
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.289
Jihoon: I'd like to share some updates.

6
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.849
Jihoon: It's a bit leggy, is it still leggy for you?

7
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.209
Jihoon: Not sure why.

8
00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:01.669
nflaig: Yeah, maybe it's on my end. But it's good. Oh, it's not good, but it's, fine enough to understand you.

9
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.530
Jihoon: Okay, yeah.

10
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.039
Jihoon: then maybe I can go a little bit slower.

11
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:19.409
Jihoon: So, for today, I'd like to share some updates on the headliner proposal, and the plan forward that I have in my mind.

12
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:27.749
Jihoon: Yeah, so we are working on the headliner proposal, which is almost finished. We're gonna share it soon.

13
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:47.510
Jihoon: Assuming that fossil makes it to Hagota, I'm gonna write a CL spec for Hagota, because what we have today is a PR that specifies fossil on top of Kolas, but what we want is a spec in H-star, so…

14
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.319
Jihoon: We need to work on that, so…

15
00:09:50.670 --> 00:10:01.409
Jihoon: I can also update other specs as well, and then while people are busy with the PBS and other Kalamsterdam EIPs, which I expect

16
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:13.290
Jihoon: around mid-2026, maybe, we can work on spec tests. So, yeah, this is it from my end. Do we have any questions or anything to discuss?

17
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.370
Jihoon: Or any development updates.

18
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:49.450
nflaig: So, I guess the question is, when do we plan to rebase fossil on EPBS, maybe?

19
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:58.280
nflaig: I guess it would be after the first definite, maybe? Or do we plan to have it for the indoor op in May?

20
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.669
Jihoon: What do you think? I, I think it…

21
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:14.510
Jihoon: it would depend on the maturity of a PBS implementation, right? So, it will happen after Glamsterdam anyway, so…

22
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.580
Jihoon: And that means we don't have to rush.

23
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:26.180
Jihoon: But from your experience, like, then… would it make sense to try… implementing…

24
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:34.129
Jihoon: fork N plus 1 while you're working on fork N, and then try interrupt between clients.

25
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.700
Jihoon: Okay, I think…

26
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:55.730
Jihoon: We didn't have to make a decision today, so we can just see how it goes around, I don't know, mid-March, which I expect.

27
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:03.380
Jihoon: We can have the first DPBS DevNet by that time, and then we can just check in with other client teams.

28
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.829
Jihoon: How they want to go about this, and then… yeah.

29
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.310
Jihoon: Yeah, I agree with that.

30
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.890
Jihoon: That's why I…

31
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:34.360
Jihoon: the plan that I have in my mind is, we can just work on spec tests before, we can work on implementation.

32
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:51.719
Jihoon: Alright, any more questions, or something to discuss?

33
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.870
Jihoon: Otherwise, we can just go ahead and wrap up this call, Ollie, so…

34
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:14.429
Jihoon: Alright, thank you guys, have a great rest of your day, and see you in Twix!

35
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.270
nflaig: Thanks, ya.

36
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.830
Jihoon: Thank you, bye-bye.

37
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.480
Mehdi Aouadi: Bye.
