00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.160
Antonio Sanso: Hey, Mike?

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.180
Mike: Right, hi, hi.

3
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.060
Antonio Sanso: Can you hear me, any chance?

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.260
Mike: Yes, yes.

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.330
Antonio Sanso: Hey, how's it going?

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.159
Mike: Good, good, how are you?

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.990
Antonio Sanso: All good? Ready to present?

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.680
Mike: Yes.

9
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.920
Antonio Sanso: Cool.

10
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.500
Antonio Sanso: Of course, it's like, I'm always, like, connecting a bit early, I…

11
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.790
Antonio Sanso: 4 is officially starting, but, I usually wait, a couple of minutes.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.049
Mike: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, makes sense, makes sense.

13
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.770
Antonio Sanso: And, as well, I will have

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.970
Antonio Sanso: 2-3 minutes presentation, just to set the stage.

15
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.600
Antonio Sanso: And then… Sounds good, sounds good, yeah. It's gonna be you.

16
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260
Antonio Sanso: Is Jonas as well, joining?

17
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.199
Mike: He cannot, unfortunately. We have a parallel call that he must attend, so…

18
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.270
Antonio Sanso: I… I guess he knows already the content of the presentation, does he?

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.770
Mike: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so…

20
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.440
Antonio Sanso: Very cool.

21
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.450
Antonio Sanso: Alessandra…

22
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.310
Alessandro Baiocchi: Hi.

23
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.240
Alessandro Baiocchi: Can you agree?

24
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.730
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, sure. I was telling you that, you would… I mean, it's still early, it's not even 4 o'clock, but…

25
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.649
Antonio Sanso: Wait a few more minutes, usually, like, you know.

26
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.720
Antonio Sanso: The academic couple of minutes.

27
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.970
Alessandro Baiocchi: Yep. Sure, sure, no problem.

28
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.039
Antonio Sanso: I got a tip.

29
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.699
Gaudenzio NeverLocal: Hey, Antonio!

30
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.990
Antonio Sanso: Hey, Fab.

31
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.350
Fab: -Oh.

32
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.130
Antonio Sanso: Adam?

33
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.140
Antonio Sanso: I'm at the…

34
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.430
Antonio Sanso: Hi, Keegan.

35
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.510
Antonio Sanso: We will have as well, some note-taker, so soon we're gonna have more agents than the new man in the calls, but…

36
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.740
Antonio Sanso: This took 2026, so it's good.

37
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.750
Antonio Sanso: Hi everyone, I just joined,

38
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.489
Antonio Sanso: We're waiting a few more minutes, a couple more minutes, and then we'll start. I will have, like, a short, presentation to…

39
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.429
Antonio Sanso: set the stage, and then we'll go for the agenda. One more minute, and we'll start.

40
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.070
Antonio Sanso: I'll start sharing my screen.

41
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.679
Antonio Sanso: Can you guys see it? And can anyone confirm?

42
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.700
Mike: Yep, yep.

43
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:42.489
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, I mean, we're 2 minutes over. This meeting is then, in any case, recorded, so I will just start, and again, I will have just a short presentation to set the stage. Welcome, everyone, to the breakout room number two. Thanks a lot for attending.

44
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.879
Antonio Sanso: I spent this couple of weeks to just do a recap of the situation.

45
00:04:48.770 --> 00:05:01.910
Antonio Sanso: And, I will post this online later on, but this is a kind of, table that compares, the next postman signature schemes, and, different access,

46
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.340
Antonio Sanso: So basically, last week, we were seeing a bit of, lattice,

47
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:28.220
Antonio Sanso: signal schemes, and here is a quick recap of what we've seen so far. For example, like, the signal size, Falcon is shorter than the dilithium, so it's in green, and the Gasper compiles, we've seen Renault and Simon showing that for the, for the…

48
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.140
Antonio Sanso: pre-compile the gases, Falcons as well, cheaper,

49
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:45.679
Antonio Sanso: We know this already, and it's kind of important. For aggregating the signatures, it's really important for the main pool, but probably we're going to see this in the future. Falcon has some solution that is based on something… something…

50
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:53.089
Antonio Sanso: some paper, they call Labrador, but with didilithium, it's, yeah, it's not so friendly.

51
00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:12.419
Antonio Sanso: And, where Falcon has issues at the moment is, and Dalidium is better, is, on the hardware. Historically, like, we know that, Falcon relies for signing on floating point, and this is actually for, for Ledger or this kind of hardware. This is…

52
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.489
Antonio Sanso: Might be complicated.

53
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:28.799
Antonio Sanso: And yeah, we'll see in probably some future calls, the threshold friendliness for post-controlled signal tourists, in any case, a disaster. We have today some presentation on Sphinx, TSS.

54
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:41.029
Antonio Sanso: And, yeah, this is basically it. Today, we are… a lot of, topics are, at least for the presentation, about, symmetric cream, so,

55
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:55.370
Antonio Sanso: submit primitives that are, based on hashing, so… and here we have as well some recap on the standard Sphinx. We see that, yeah, we see a bit of red here and there, and

56
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.050
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, this is the agenda.

57
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:08.260
Antonio Sanso: We will have, Mikhail presenting their version of the hash-based signature scheme that is more efficient for blockchains.

58
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.610
Antonio Sanso: Then, actually, we have Nico that will have a cool demo showing this in action.

59
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:21.480
Antonio Sanso: And we'll have, Yasvanda and Naman seeing the difficulty of having, threshold signatures.

60
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.090
Antonio Sanso: For, hash-based schemes. And then, ideally, we will have some…

61
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.729
Antonio Sanso: more minutes. I did 20, 30 minutes to discuss.

62
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.190
Antonio Sanso: stuff.

63
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.740
Antonio Sanso: And if you don't have any more questions, I will give the stage to Mikhail.

64
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.260
Antonio Sanso: Totally, we can start early.

65
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.799
Antonio Sanso: Mikhail, the stage is yours.

66
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.770
Mike: Thank you.

67
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.330
Mike: You should be able to see my screen now.

68
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.400
Antonio Sanso: Yep, all good.

69
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.099
Mike: Oh, good. So, yeah, I will, give a brief,

70
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:15.059
Mike: summary of what you can do with hash-based schemes for the scenarios such as blockchains. We specifically looked at Bitcoin application, but I think most of our findings are, in general, applicable

71
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.650
Mike: To the blockchain environment.

72
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:35.800
Mike: So, obviously, while we're here, we have the quantum thread, we want to move to post-quantum solutions, so in case, when our… whatever quantum computer appears, we're safe, we're secure.

73
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:53.409
Mike: And, the options are actually quite… there are quite a lot of options. You can do lettuces, you can do hash-based. For lattices, you have a variety of schemes. Unfortunately, none of them is as good as our classical counterparts.

74
00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:01.429
Mike: And today we will look at hash-based schemes, and what they can offer, what are the upsides, what are the downsides.

75
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:21.690
Mike: And the first, and arguably the most important upside of the hash-based schemes is their security. So it's super conservative, everybody is using hashing everywhere, there is no problem with that. If we don't have hash functions, we essentially don't have

76
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:30.479
Mike: Almost any cryptography, all the latest-based schemes still use hash functions, so this is as minimal as you can get.

77
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:52.039
Mike: But the problem, as we saw on the slides before, is that the sizes are quite large. For… there is this scheme, Sphinx Plus, which has been standardized, and, for the best sizes, kind of, there are multiple,

78
00:09:52.040 --> 00:10:01.019
Mike: parameters were selected, and if we select the one with the best size, I think it's something like 7.5 kilobytes.

79
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.490
Mike: That's huge.

80
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:12.299
Mike: Where does this come from? Is, we have this structure, it's called a hypertree. So, essentially, it's a Merkel tree, at the top.

81
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:26.640
Mike: The leaves of the Merkel tree are one-time signature schemes, so they can only sign once, and we use those signatures to sign Merkel trees on the next level, and so on and so on and so on, until we get to the very bottom.

82
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:50.060
Mike: where we use, so-called few-time signature scheme, which we actually use to sign the message. So we have this kind of, certification, kind of. You have this, root of the top, Merkel tree, and then you show, okay, I do this signature, and I attach the annification pass for here, I do this signature identification pass, and so on, so on, so on.

83
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:56.619
Mike: And so you have to include everything that we just discussed, and this were the…

84
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.820
Mike: Sizes, come from.

85
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:09.690
Mike: But, there are a couple of optimizations. The core idea here is that this tree can be used only for a limited number of signings.

86
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:28.979
Mike: Essentially, if we forget about few times signatures, the idea is to create a tree big enough so that if I sample a leaf at random, they will not collide. With the few times signatures, they shouldn't collide too often, but that's…

87
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:41.750
Mike: the small detail. And so, NIST, asked for, a scheme that will be able to perform 2 to the 64, signing operations.

88
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:53.060
Mike: And, for our applications, we don't need 2 to the 64 signatures. That's… that's a definite, statement.

89
00:11:53.310 --> 00:12:01.090
Mike: We looked at some numbers, and I think even, like, 2 to the 35 signatures.

90
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:09.480
Mike: of size 3 kilobytes will fulfill, the whole Bitcoin, blocks for, I don't know.

91
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:18.889
Mike: 100 years, or something like this. I should double-check the parameters, but yeah, the 2 to the 64 is a huge overkill.

92
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:26.309
Mike: And, this is not a novel idea, that actually you can limit the number of signatures for hash-based schemes.

93
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:37.380
Mike: And, there is, I believe, currently also an ongoing process in NIST to standardize a scheme with fewer number signatures, so…

94
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:43.619
Mike: On the slide, you can see the presentation by Stefan and Jade that were also…

95
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:57.749
Mike: searching for different parameters by just reducing the allowed number of signatures. As you can see, so these, green triangles here, this is different parameters for, 2 to the 64 signings.

96
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.599
Mike: Yeah, if we go as low as, here, it is somewhere around 7,000, I think, here.

97
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:13.720
Mike: But if we go, for example, for 2 to the 20 signatures, you can get much, much smaller signature sizes.

98
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.349
Mike: So this is the first, and arguably the most obvious,

99
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:31.650
Mike: Modification that you can make is, decide, in your scenario, what is, what is the limit that you are happy with, and just limit that.

100
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:42.310
Mike: The upside of doing nothing else is that, essentially, you're more or less Can reuse the existing implementations.

101
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:55.300
Mike: Maybe in the future, you will be able to use some hardware acceleration, but this hardware acceleration, question mark, if it will be there or not, specifically for Sphinx.

102
00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:06.019
Mike: And, whether you could use the acceleration with different parameters, this is… this is not entirely obvious, but at least you can reuse implementations.

103
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.959
Mike: Then, if you think, okay, I'm…

104
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:27.299
Mike: still happy to deviate from the standard, and arguably the most popular version of hash-based signatures, then there are also different modifications that you can implement. So, as you saw on the slides, we have different building blocks here.

105
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:34.860
Mike: We have one-time signature schemes, we have few-time signature schemes here, and so if you change them.

106
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.750
Mike: Because, researchers came up with…

107
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:43.269
Mike: Arguably something better. You can also change the performance.

108
00:14:44.120 --> 00:15:01.129
Mike: And, most of this, or most of these modifications, what they do is they put extra, effort on the signer, so the signer needs to do more work, but this will either reduce the,

109
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.050
Mike: Sizes, or verification complexity.

110
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:15.080
Mike: Sometimes, we increase both the siting complexity and verification complexity to get more

111
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.849
Mike: To reduce the signatures even more.

112
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.349
Mike: And so, what, we can see this, on, on this slide.

113
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:35.840
Mike: We have, Sphinx, this is the first line, and, as I said, yes, 7,872 bytes. Yeah, this is, this is pretty, pretty sad.

114
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.890
Mike: And,

115
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:51.629
Mike: we can start limiting the number of signatures, and here, in this column, we say, okay, which modifications to apply. And already here, you can see that we can get as low as 4,600.

116
00:15:51.750 --> 00:16:02.550
Mike: With similar signing time, and similar verification time, yeah? Okay, this is twice worse, but this is no big deal, and here's the same.

117
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:15.329
Mike: And, if we apply even more modifications, then we can get as low as 4 kilobytes for 2 to the 40. And 2 to the 40 is

118
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:25.210
Mike: Arguably also an overkill. Then, if you're happy to go even lower to the 30, you can reach, 3.5.

119
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:44.910
Mike: kilobytes for different cases, depends on how many modifications you want, and depends on how much, are you happy to put on the verifier. And I must say here, yeah, you have, the numbers, 8,000 compared to 2,000 here.

120
00:16:44.910 --> 00:17:01.509
Mike: This is quite, quite low, actually. The 2,000 hashes to compute is not a big deal for the verifier, so it is arguably completely fine to push it even to the 10,000. This is not a big problem here.

121
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:09.209
Mike: And if you're happy with around 1 million signatures, you can go even below 3 kilobytes.

122
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:22.289
Mike: And I think this is really nice, because we start with almost 8KB signatures, and we actually can get to somewhere around 3 kilobytes, which is much, much better.

123
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:41.640
Mike: And, people always say, okay, lettuce-based, they have quite small signatures compared to lattices, compared to hash-based. And again, yes, yes, the signatures are smaller, but for most of the blockchain applications, you should actually compare signature plus the public key.

124
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:49.899
Mike: Because you will need to put both of them on chain. And, if we compare Didilithium with,

125
00:17:50.070 --> 00:18:02.560
Mike: our modified hash-based parameters. Okay, yes, the dilithium can support more, but do we need more? And then the sizes can even go, in these scenarios, can even go better.

126
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:15.589
Mike: And, another, I think, which is quite, quite popular topic right now, especially in Bitcoin, is a scheme which, which was called Shrinks.

127
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:24.240
Mike: Which introduces the idea of mixing two different hash-based schemes together.

128
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:37.460
Mike: The thing is, when we talk about Sphinx Plus, it is a stateless scheme. That means you do the signing, and you don't need to update your secret key, so that, yeah.

129
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.060
Mike: You just do the signatures, and you don't need…

130
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.230
Mike: To modify your secret key.

131
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:55.250
Mike: there is, there are stateful, hash-based signature schemes, and an example, you can see on the left side, essentially you do a Merkle tree with one-time signatures at the bottom.

132
00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:09.319
Mike: for example, this one can sign four messages, yeah? You need to remember which ones you have already used. So, the first message you sign with the first leaf, the second message with the second one, third with the third, and fourth with the first.

133
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:15.299
Mike: If you run out of leaves, you're done, and you shouldn't reuse the same leaf twice.

134
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.200
Mike: And,

135
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:26.440
Mike: Such schemes are more efficient than stateless, but the problem is, yeah, you have to store and modify the state.

136
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:45.389
Mike: And this is especially annoying if you want to do backups and then restore the backup, the backup should have the state, and you… every time you sign, you kinda need to update the backup, otherwise you won't be able to use it, and so… this is a little bit annoying.

137
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:56.750
Mike: But moreover, what we can do is, instead of using a Merkle tree, kind of a usual, usually balanced Merkeley, we can use an unbalanced Merkel tree.

138
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:05.060
Mike: Which means that the first leaf is just one, path away from the root.

139
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:18.480
Mike: And so, the first signature will be super cheap. I think, according to our computations, it's something like 300 bytes. 300 bytes is just nothing in the post-quantum,

140
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.979
Mike: Cases, I don't think any other signature can achieve

141
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.639
Mike: 300 bytes, yeah, this is… this is nothing.

142
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:32.649
Mike: And, the second one will grow, so here you will need to include more.

143
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:42.149
Mike: Because you need to include the identification pass, so you will need, yeah, extra, extra nodes to include, and so on.

144
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.810
Mike: But also to mitigate the statefulness.

145
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:57.599
Mike: we can combine our stateful scheme with the stateless version. Okay, here it's written Sphinx+, but essentially you can plug in whatever we discussed on the previous slides.

146
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:08.660
Mike: And then you have this… Arguably a nice combination of, statefulness with very cheap, signatures.

147
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.600
Mike: Plus the stateless for a backup in case something went wrong.

148
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.910
Mike: This has also its potential downside, because stateful is still…

149
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:31.739
Mike: annoying to work with. You still need to update the state. If you generate multiple addresses, so essentially you generate multiple key pairs, you need to store the state for each key pair.

150
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.709
Mike: You cannot allow two signing devices to operate in parallel.

151
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.720
Mike: There are a lot of caveats there as well.

152
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:46.850
Mike: But, as a, as a plus, you get, you get quite, quite small signatures.

153
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.990
Mike: Yeah, I think this can, summarizes

154
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:59.840
Mike: Overall, the ideas that we… that we… Discovered so far?

155
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:14.479
Mike: I think I can also… we also checked different, extra applications as, threshold signatures or multi-signatures that, will be later discussed, during this, call.

156
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:24.740
Mike: But, from our findings so far, there was… there was some approaches, but none of them are super efficient and don't give too much.

157
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:30.620
Mike: Maybe there's something extra that we don't know, but let's see that later in this call.

158
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:40.870
Antonio Sanso: Mike, thanks a lot for your presentation. This is… was a really interesting result, to see that actually, happening.

159
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:52.649
Antonio Sanso: And, I will ask you if to, please, if you can, answer… there are some questions on the chat, interest of time, if you can answer in the chat rather than, than, by voice, so…

160
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:53.270
Mike: Yeah, sure.

161
00:22:53.270 --> 00:23:01.890
Antonio Sanso: We'll give the stage to Nico, and actually, it's really beautiful, because Nico, as far as I know, already implemented part

162
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:07.939
Antonio Sanso: of your work, and we'll show it in action, on Ethereum. So this is…

163
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.390
Antonio Sanso: I cannot imagine any better segue.

164
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.500
Antonio Sanso: Nico, if you're here, this is your time shine.

165
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.269
Nicolas Consigny: Thank you, thank you.

166
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.530
Nicolas Consigny: So I'm gonna try to share my screen.

167
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.470
Nicolas Consigny: Let's see…

168
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.690
Nicolas Consigny: Okay.

169
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.450
Nicolas Consigny: Can you see my screen now?

170
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.430
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, yeah, we see it. All good.

171
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.120
Nicolas Consigny: Another short presentation…

172
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:51.909
Nicolas Consigny: So, I figured out that, like, it's better to give a short presentation rather than just, you know, showing you.

173
00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:52.450
Antonio Sanso: For sure.

174
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.299
Nicolas Consigny: what? Hold on, slideshow?

175
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:11.319
Nicolas Consigny: All right, so yeah, I just wanted to make a quick presentation, rather than showing you, my script and my deployments, because this would be just me typing a few comments in the terminal.

176
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:27.230
Nicolas Consigny: So what did I do? I actually tweaked the Blockstream research work. So Blockstream has a very nice repo where you can look for Sphinx parameters that are nice for you.

177
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.000
Nicolas Consigny: So, in the EVM context, you have a slightly different

178
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:43.189
Nicolas Consigny: Constraints, because you have gas, and basically, it becomes, a research of, the most efficient,

179
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:54.269
Nicolas Consigny: parameters within the EVM constraints, so same as for other blockchains, you have the reuse constraints, so you want to be able to reuse your

180
00:24:54.350 --> 00:25:08.470
Nicolas Consigny: your scheme a certain number of times, so that people don't have to change wallets all the time. And to combine this with some gas efficiency.

181
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:17.230
Nicolas Consigny: So doing this… I ended up, finding a bunch of sweet spots.

182
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:30.919
Nicolas Consigny: And I tried two of them in deployment. So these are the sweet spots that I found, and good to mention here that I, yeah, I looked a little bit, but I didn't look that much.

183
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:43.600
Nicolas Consigny: So maybe someone can find a better sweet spot, and there is a lot of design space here. So yeah, this is just a presentation to open the discussion around this, but it is by no means,

184
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.299
Nicolas Consigny: the Canon Equal or the best solution that I found.

185
00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:56.449
Antonio Sanso: We're just trying to decipher this. Is this, like, if you try to correlate this with the presentation of Mike, is this, like, the strings?

186
00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:05.759
Antonio Sanso: Or are the… the XMSS, or the Sphinx? Which, which family is this? Because… Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

187
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.410
Nicolas Consigny: So these are a different, variants of,

188
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:18.169
Nicolas Consigny: That are actually explained in the… Let me recheck… This link… oh.

189
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.300
Nicolas Consigny: The variants are actually explained in the…

190
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:30.490
Nicolas Consigny: in the repo here. So W plus C is Banks Plus with…

191
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:44.909
Nicolas Consigny: VOTs, with counter-based, VOTs, so no checks from on the chain. So you can find everything, like, all the details, all the different families inside the, the repo, inside the Sphinx Parameters repo.

192
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:51.660
Nicolas Consigny: So it's basically just a bunch of variants of Sphinx, and they have different, properties.

193
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.650
Nicolas Consigny: So if I go back to slideshow…

194
00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:07.460
Nicolas Consigny: Yeah, so these are different families of Sphinx, and we… we select… I selected this, these ones, because they just look nice, not too big, somewhat…

195
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.540
Nicolas Consigny: Easy to, to, to, to verify.

196
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:17.160
Nicolas Consigny: And yeah, so I have this, small repo where I try to…

197
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:25.880
Nicolas Consigny: to do it, and earlier today, I deployed them on a test network, just to find the real cost.

198
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:44.869
Nicolas Consigny: So I ended up with transactions that are about 400K, but these are 4337 transactions, so there is a large overhead for the 4337 framework, so there is the overhead for the entry point and a bunch of

199
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:52.820
Nicolas Consigny: different things. So these are, hybrid accounts that are relying both on a K1,

200
00:27:52.990 --> 00:28:05.830
Nicolas Consigny: K1 signature and the post-quantum signature, so I copied the work from Zeke and Ox, who presented last time, and I simply tweaked it with my two schemes.

201
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:16.330
Nicolas Consigny: And, it's, it's quite interesting, because, we can have, under 200K, gas,

202
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:19.410
Nicolas Consigny: signature with, the C2 scheme.

203
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:25.319
Nicolas Consigny: And 250K gas with the C3 scheme.

204
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:39.890
Nicolas Consigny: So this is something that is, big. It's about, yeah, 10 times bigger than, a regular K1 signature, but it's not crazy big. So this is, yeah, this is something doable.

205
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:48.230
Nicolas Consigny: And yes, so you have the cost, breakdown here, so you can see the…

206
00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:53.829
Nicolas Consigny: The debug trace from the… From the transactions.

207
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.880
Nicolas Consigny: I will publish the transaction, probably, with the repo, so everyone can look at them.

208
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:14.780
Nicolas Consigny: And, yes, so this, scheme retains, so it's, to make a parallel with the previous presentation, this one is, is okay with… at 120 bits with 2 to the 20 signatures, so that's roughly a million signatures.

209
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:25.660
Nicolas Consigny: at, 128 bits of security. Then it goes down, quite nicely, because it goes… it still allows you for, like, 4 million signatures.

210
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:33.870
Nicolas Consigny: up to 112 bits of security. So if we bring that back to the context of a wallet.

211
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:44.010
Nicolas Consigny: You don't have that many people who sign millions of transactions on-chain, and if you do sign millions of transactions, you probably…

212
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:59.799
Nicolas Consigny: are a very, very advanced user, so you somewhat know what to do. C3 is slightly more expensive, but retains more security, so you can keep, about 140 million transactions at 120 bits.

213
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:06.589
Nicolas Consigny: of security, so that's really a lot. Actually, I checked quickly, and nobody has,

214
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:13.499
Nicolas Consigny: hundreds of millions of transactions with the same wallet pair on the execution layer. So, yeah, it is…

215
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:24.169
Nicolas Consigny: It is a very interesting design space to explore. So I have this meme right now, the best competitor that we have is this guy.

216
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:42.919
Nicolas Consigny: And yeah, to finish the presentation, I did all of this very quickly. I'm not a cryptographer. I have a lot of cryptographers in my colleagues and friends, so we will be looking into it, and maybe… maybe I'm wrong, so if I'm wrong, we'll just get it and find,

217
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.040
Nicolas Consigny: Another set of parameters that is.

218
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.660
Nicolas Consigny: It's a good one.

219
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.040
Nicolas Consigny: So yeah, that's it for today. I will taste…

220
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.760
Antonio Sanso: Call me…

221
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:59.450
Antonio Sanso: just because, like, it's true that there are 10 times bigger than ACDSA, but it's as well 10 times…

222
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:08.430
Antonio Sanso: less than the Falcon we've seen last week, so it's… actually, it's a remarkable low number of gas, right?

223
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:18.970
Antonio Sanso: The question I will have… probably, I should have a question before as well to Mike was about the creation of the…

224
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.929
Nicolas Consigny: I think we need to…

225
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.140
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: I've got action!

226
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.169
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: I got homework in Mexico.

227
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.850
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: They just said to you when they saw me.

228
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.659
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: She is hug you think us.

229
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.059
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Don't stop it!

230
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.650
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: He said, I mean?

231
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.529
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: This shit is real.

232
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.240
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Have you safely.

233
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.440
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: All we're getting is.

234
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:45.920
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Man, I'm

235
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.462
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Neither… Top of the

236
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.250
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: I do not play.

237
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.279
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Yeah, kinda true.

238
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.769
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Wait, not the fuck?

239
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.780
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Oh, my goodness.

240
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.850
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: I've been afraid to not sleeping, Needles!

241
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.420
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: You can call America!

242
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.250
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: That's not my feeling.

243
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:54.160
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: That was…

244
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.220
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Oh my god!

245
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.410
ௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌௌ: Goodbye.
