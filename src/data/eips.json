Currently, the EVM stack can hold 1024 items but only the top 16 are easily accessible. These new instructions help compilers write more efficient code for complex functions with many variables by providing better stack management capabilities. The feature only works with the new EOF bytecode format, not legacy contracts."

They return extensible status codes (0=success, 1=revert, 2=failure) instead of boolean values, remove output buffer complexity in favor of RETURNDATACOPY, and add RETURNDATALOAD for efficient return data access. This makes contracts more resilient to future gas repricing and eliminates many gas-related attack vectors while simplifying the calling mechanism."

Currently, when blob demand exceeds supply, it takes too long for prices to climb from the extremely low minimum to actual market rates. The new minimum corresponds to about 1 cent at current ETH prices, similar to the cost of a simple transaction when gas fees are low. The change also resets excess blob gas to zero to prevent a sudden price spike when the upgrade activates. This helps blob-based rollups reach appropriate pricing faster during high-demand periods."

The problem it solves is that EOF removes the ability to read raw contract code, but contracts still need to know when an account is delegating execution to another address. This instruction takes an address and returns the actual address that will execute the code - for regular accounts it returns the same address, but for delegated accounts it returns the address they're delegating to. This enables important use cases like managed proxy contracts ensuring they don't delegate to unsafe addresses, sponsorship contracts verifying delegation hasn't changed during a transaction, and security-conscious contracts that only accept specific delegation targets."

This EIP solves the problem by automatically emitting a log containing the revert message whenever the REVERT opcode is called. This makes error messages accessible through standard RPC calls without any tracing, helping wallets, block explorers, and other tools display helpful error messages to users. It's completely backward compatible and doesn't require any new opcodes or RPC methods."

Currently, beacon blocks contain all transaction data embedded within them, but as Ethereum aims to increase block sizes (potentially by 10x), this creates serious networking and processing problems. Larger transaction payloads cause higher latencies for block transmission, increased bandwidth requirements, and longer block processing times that hurt validator performance. This EIP solves these issues by replacing the full transaction data in beacon blocks with just a header, while transmitting the actual transaction data separately. This allows the consensus layer to process blocks quickly while handling much larger transaction payloads independently. Additional benefits include reduced storage requirements for beacon nodes, more efficient proposer-builder separation, and laying groundwork for future innovations like ZK-proof-based execution validation where transaction data could be handled similarly to blobs with data availability sampling."

    "laymanDescription": "This removes the 49,152-byte limit on initialization code (initcode) that was introduced by EIP-3860. The problem this solves is that the current limit makes it unnecessarily difficult to deploy large, complex smart contracts that need to create multiple sub-contracts in a single transaction. For example, if you want to deploy a sophisticated DeFi protocol that consists of several interconnected contracts, you might hit the initcode limit even though each final contract stays under the 24KB deployed code limit (EIP-170). This forces developers to split deployments across multiple transactions, which is more expensive, less efficient, and breaks the clean abstractions that high-level programming languages try to provide. By removing this artificial limit, the EIP allows for more flexible deployment patterns while still maintaining security through existing gas costs that scale with initcode size. The per-block gas limit already naturally restricts initcode to reasonable sizes (around 16MB at current gas limits), making the 49KB cap redundant. This change is fully backward compatible and only removes restrictions without changing how contracts work.",

It extends the existing SWAP and DUP instructions to reach deeper stack positions (up to 24 positions), adds dynamic SWAPN and DUPN instructions for variable depth access, and introduces an EXCHANGE instruction that can swap any two arbitrary stack positions. These tools help compilers generate more efficient code when dealing with complex functions that have many local variables, reducing gas costs and bytecode size. Unlike previous attempts that required new code formats, this proposal works with existing legacy contracts by requiring specific PUSH instructions before the dynamic operations, making it a pragmatic solution that provides better stack access without breaking backward compatibility."
