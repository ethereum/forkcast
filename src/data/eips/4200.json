  "laymanDescription": "This introduces three new jump instructions (RJUMP, RJUMPI, and RJUMPV) for EOF contracts that use relative addressing instead of absolute addressing. These instructions are more gas-efficient than traditional JUMP/JUMPI instructions, don't require JUMPDEST markers, and make code analysis easier. RJUMP does unconditional jumps, RJUMPI does conditional jumps, and RJUMPV provides jump tables for switch-case scenarios. The relative addressing means code can be moved around without breaking, and the static nature allows for better optimization and validation at deployment time."
