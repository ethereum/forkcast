  "laymanDescription": "This introduces proper function support to EOF contracts by allowing multiple code sections, each representing a separate function. It adds two new instructions: CALLF to call functions and RETF to return from them. Functions have defined input/output parameters and their own isolated stack, improving code organization and analysis. Dynamic jumps (JUMP/JUMPI) are completely removed in favor of static function calls, making contracts more predictable and easier to optimize. A return stack tracks function call history, and JUMPDEST becomes a simple NOP instruction since jump analysis is no longer needed."
