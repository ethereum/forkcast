  "laymanDescription": "This restructures how gas costs work to prepare for stateless clients - nodes that can validate blocks without storing the entire blockchain state. The changes ensure gas costs accurately reflect the new computational model.",
  "northStarAlignment": {
    "scaleL1": {
      "description": "Essential foundation for stateless clients, which enable massive improvements in node syncing speed and storage requirements. Enables nodes to validate without storing full state."

    "endUsers": {
      "description": "Indirect benefits through improved network decentralization and faster node syncing, but gas cost changes may affect some transaction patterns."

    "appDevs": {
      "description": "Some operations may have different gas costs, requiring optimization of smart contracts for the new stateless execution model."
    },
    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "Need to update gas estimation for transactions affected by the new cost model, but most operations remain similar."
    },
    "toolingInfra": {
      "description": "Major updates needed for gas estimation, transaction simulation, and stateless proof generation. Block explorers need stateless verification capabilities."

    "layer2s": {
      "description": "May need to adjust for new gas costs in settlement transactions and state access patterns."

    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "Can run much lighter nodes using stateless validation, dramatically reducing storage and syncing requirements while maintaining security."
