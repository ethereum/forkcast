  "laymanDescription": "This proposes transitioning Ethereum's entire state system from Merkle Patricia tries to Verkle trees. This foundational change would enable stateless clients, dramatically faster syncing, and better scalability while maintaining security. However, it's competing with other major proposals for Glamsterdam.",
