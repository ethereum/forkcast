  "laymanDescription": "This proposal ties how much EVM memory a transaction can use directly to its gas. It simplifies memory pricing rules so each unit of gas corresponds to at most one byte of memory, making worst-case resource use easier to understand for operators and developers.",
  "stakeholderImpacts": {
    "endUsers": {
      "description": "For ordinary users this change is largely invisible, mainly constraining unusually memory-heavy transactions that approach gas and resource limits."
    },
    "appDevs": {
      "description": "Contract developers may review patterns that access high memory with little gas, though typical applications fit within the new limits."
    },
    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "Wallets that implement their own gas estimation must update memory-cost logic; others inherit the behavior change from underlying nodes."
    },
    "toolingInfra": {
      "description": "Gas analyzers, simulators, and tracing tools must update their memory cost and call-gas models to match the new linear rules."
    },
    "layer2s": {
      "description": "EVM-compatible rollups mirroring mainnet gas rules would implement the new memory limit and pricing to maintain behavior compatibility."
    },
    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "Node operators benefit from a linear bound on per-transaction memory usage, simplifying capacity planning and reducing worst-case memory exhaustion risk."
    },
    "clClients": {
      "description": "Consensus-layer clients see minimal direct impact; they mainly ensure testing and fork configuration align with updated execution-layer behavior."
    },
    "elClients": {
      "description": "Execution-layer clients must update EVM memory-cost calculation, enforce the new per-context memory cap, and adjust call-gas logic accordingly."
    }

  "benefits": [
    "Provides a clear linear upper bound on total memory a transaction can consume.",
    "Simplifies EVM memory pricing by removing the quadratic term from the cost function.",
    "Makes worst-case resource usage easier to estimate for EVM executions and client operators.",
    "Aligns call-gas limits with memory usage, avoiding unbounded memory growth across nested sub-calls."
