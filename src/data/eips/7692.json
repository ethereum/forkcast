  "laymanDescription": "This introduces a new container format for EVM bytecode that enables code versioning, removes complex jump analysis, and paves the way for new execution environments like RISC-V and EVM64 within the same contract. This EIP was Declined for Inclusion from Fusaka on [April 28th](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/04/29/checkpoint-2#eof) due to a lack of consensus on implementation details and the resulting potential slowdown of shipping PeerDAS. It has been re-proposed as a headlining feature in Glamsterdam with multiple variants to address community concerns.",
