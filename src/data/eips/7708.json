  "laymanDescription": "Make every ETH transfer—including from contracts and SELFDESTRUCT—emit an event log. Apps and explorers can track ETH movements uniformly, similar to ERC-20 transfers, improving deposit detection and reducing ad-hoc tracing.",

      "description": "Deposits and withdrawals are detected more reliably across apps and exchanges; no change to how users send or receive ETH."

      "description": "Can subscribe to a standard ETH transfer log instead of tracing; requires small updates to indexers and business logic."

      "description": "Optionally watch a canonical event for ETH transfers to improve UX; otherwise existing send/receive flows remain unchanged."

      "description": "Explorers and data indexers must parse and surface the new log; moderate engineering to integrate, test, and backfill if desired."

      "description": "Rollups mirroring L1 EVM semantics may add the same log for consistency; others have no direct requirements."

    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "More log entries per block; execution node receipts grow slightly, increasing storage and bandwidth requirements for some RPC setups."

    "clClients": {
      "description": "No consensus-layer changes anticipated; minimal or no code modifications beyond recognizing updated receipt sizes from execution payloads."

    "Unified, queryable signal for ETH transfers across EOAs and contracts.",
    "Reduces reliance on tracing for ETH balance change detection.",
