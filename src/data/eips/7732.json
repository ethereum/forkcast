  "laymanDescription": "Proposes the decoupling of the consensus block from the execution payload, both in broadcast and validation. This feature enables L1 scaling by significantly changing the time required to both broadcast and executing the payload together with all the blob data, from the current ~2 seconds to aproximately ~9 seconds. It allows for a maximum portion of the slot to be spent in propagation large data.",
