  "laymanDescription": "This increases the minimum blob base fee from 1 wei to 2^25 wei (about 33 million times higher) to speed up blob price discovery. Currently, when blob demand exceeds supply, it takes too long for prices to climb from the extremely low minimum to actual market rates. The new minimum corresponds to about 1 cent at current ETH prices, similar to the cost of a simple transaction when gas fees are low. The change also resets excess blob gas to zero to prevent a sudden price spike when the upgrade activates. This helps blob-based rollups reach appropriate pricing faster during high-demand periods."
