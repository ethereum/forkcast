  "laymanDescription": "This proposes automatic, controlled gas limit increases over time instead of relying on manual adjustments by validators. Currently, gas limits change unpredictably based on individual validator decisions, which can cause network performance issues. The EIP offers three strategies: linear (fixed increase per block), stepwise (increases in steps), and exponential (doubling over intervals). Each includes safeguards like deactivation blocks to prevent indefinite growth. This provides predictable network scaling while giving the ecosystem time to adapt to larger block sizes, and validators retain the ability to halt increases if problems arise."
