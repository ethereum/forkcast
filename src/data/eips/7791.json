  "laymanDescription": "EIP-7791 creates native fee mechanism for decentralized application by introducing a new GAS2ETH opcode that allows smart contracts to convert gas directly into ETH and send it to a specified address. It provides a new monetization mechanism for smart contract authors and public goods projects that scales with network usage. Instead of complex fee structures or token schemes, developers can charge gas (which users already understand) and receive proportional compensation during high network activity periods. The opcode takes a target address and gas amount, deducts the gas from the transaction, calculates the ETH value using the current gas price, and transfers that ETH to the specified address.",

      "description": "Wallets are estimating gas fees as always but when interacting with contracts using this opcode, the estimated fee will include the regular network fee and portion paid to the contract beneficiary address."
