      "description": "Ethereum currently relies on local block builders to preserve censorship resistance. However, depending on local block builders comes at a cost to performance and incentives, which may conflict with scaling throughput. FOCIL is crucial in L1 scaling because it helps decouple local block building from censorship resistance."
