  "laymanDescription": "This introduces a 16,777,216 gas (2^24) cap for individual transactions, preventing any single transaction from consuming most of a block. The goal is to ensure fairer access to block space and improve network stability.",

      "description": "Improves network stability and resilience against DoS attacks by preventing individual transactions from consuming excessive block space, enabling more predictable block validation times."

      "description": "More predictable transaction inclusion and fairer access to block space, though may require some large applications to restructure their operations."

  "stakeholderImpacts": {
    "endUsers": {
      "description": "Most users unaffected as typical transactions use far less than 16.8M gas. Edge cases with very complex operations may need to restructure."

    "appDevs": {
      "description": "Applications with very large transactions (complex DeFi, large contract deployments) may need to split operations or redesign architecture to stay under the cap."

      "description": "Need to enforce the gas cap in transaction creation, but most wallet operations are well below the limit."
