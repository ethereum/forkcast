    "endUsers": {
      "description": "Indirectly benefits from more reliable app timing if slot duration changes in future networks."

      "description": "Simplifies reading beacon time onchain, avoiding timestamp math and EIP-4788 proofs; fewer assumptions about the slot schedule."

      "description": "Little to no impact; wallets typically don't consume slot numbers. Optional UI or simulation support could display it."

      "description": "Block explorers, RPC simulators, and debuggers may add opcode support and parse the new header slot_number field."

    "layer2s": {
      "description": "Optional support; helpful if mirroring L1 semantics. Not required unless chains want SLOTNUM compatibility and header field parity."

    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "No operational changes expected; clients handle computation and propagation. Node operators shouldn't need configuration or workflow updates."

    "clClients": {
      "description": "Must compute slot_number and include it in headers and engine API payloads; aligns with existing consensus-layer slot calculations."

  "benefits": [
    "Removes hardcoded slot assumptions; apps remain correct if slot duration changes.",
    "Cheaper than proving slot via EIP-4788; simple 2-gas opcode call.",
    "Slot number available directly in block header and engine API.",
    "No added proving complexity; similar to TIMESTAMP for ZK-VMs."
