  "laymanDescription": "This increases the gas cost of the ModExp cryptographic precompile to address underpriced operations. It raises the minimum cost from 200 to 500 gas and doubles costs for large inputs over 32 bytes.",

      "description": "Most users unaffected. Applications using ModExp with large inputs (>32 bytes) will see increased gas costs."

      "description": "Applications using RSA verification, large modular exponentiation, or cryptographic protocols with big numbers may need to optimize or budget for higher costs."

    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "No impact as wallets typically don't use ModExp precompile directly."
