  "benefits": [
    "Asynchronous attestation before execution reduces the critical path, enabling higher gas limits and overall network throughput.",
    "Minimal checks using previous state and parent outputs let validators deem blocks valid without executing transactions.",
    "Senders are pre-charged maximum fees and balances/nonces verified, significantly reducing execution-time failures and fragile same-block dependencies.",
    "Snapshot-and-revert preserves liveness: mismatched gas used resets receipts, logs, and execution outputs without discarding blocks from the chain.",
    "Base-fee dynamics remain fair: reverted parents count as zero gas used, preventing fee-market manipulation via overdeclared usage."
