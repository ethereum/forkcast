  "status": "Draft",
  "description": "This EIP defines a JSON-RPC method, eth_config, that provides node-relevant configuration data for the current, next, and last known forks.",

  "laymanDescription": "Adds an eth_config API on Ethereum nodes so tools can read how clients are configured for current and upcoming forks, helping operators verify settings.",
  "stakeholderImpacts": {
    "endUsers": {
      "description": "End users do not interact with eth_config directly, but benefit from fewer consensus issues when operators confirm client configurations before forks."
    },
    "appDevs": {
      "description": "eth_config lets application developers who manage nodes inspect fork configuration; otherwise, the EIP does not define direct changes to application behavior."
    },
    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "Wallet developers are not a primary audience in the EIP; impacts are limited to indirect reliability improvements from correctly configured nodes during fork activations."
    },
    "toolingInfra": {
      "description": "Monitoring and infrastructure tools can call eth_config to compare configurations across nodes, automate pre-fork validation scripts, and detect configuration mismatches before upgrades."
    },
    "layer2s": {
      "description": "Layer 2 systems are not explicitly targeted; they inherit any reliability improvements from better configured L1 nodes used for bridging and settlement."
    },
    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "Node operators and validator teams are primary users: eth_config lets them inspect current and next fork parameters and confirm clients match published specifications."
    },
    "clClients": {
      "description": "Consensus layer clients that support eth_config must add code to gather fork configuration, surface it via Engine API, and track future configuration fields."
    },
    "elClients": {
      "description": "Execution layer clients implement the eth_config JSON-RPC method, assemble current/next/last configuration objects, ensure values stay synchronized with fork parameters, and handle caching or rate-limiting per recommendations."
    }
  },
  "benefits": [
    "Makes node fork configurations visible through a standardized eth_config JSON-RPC method.",
    "Helps operators and monitoring tools confirm clients are correctly configured before scheduled hard forks.",
    "Reduces risk of consensus splits caused by misconfigured fork parameters across different clients.",
    "Provides a foundation for automated pre-fork validation scripts and cross-node configuration comparisons."
