  "laymanDescription": "This makes Ethereum's block proposer schedule completely predictable ahead of time. Currently, validators can't know who will propose blocks in the next epoch until it starts, which creates uncertainty for MEV mitigation and preconfirmation protocols. This change pre-calculates and stores the proposer schedule for future epochs, making it deterministic and accessible to applications.",
