  "laymanDescription": "This addresses blob fee market problems by introducing a reserve price tied to execution costs. When Layer 2 execution costs dominate blob costs, this prevents the blob fee market from becoming ineffective at 1 wei. See a storybook-style explanation [here](https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/AIG)!",
