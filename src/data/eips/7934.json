  "laymanDescription": "This adds a maximum size limit of 10MB to Ethereum blocks to prevent network instability and denial-of-service attacks. Currently, blocks can grow very large, which slows down network propagation and increases the risk of temporary forks. This limit ensures blocks stay within a reasonable size that the network can efficiently process and propagate.",
