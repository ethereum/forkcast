  "laymanDescription": "This proposes increasing the gas limit from 36M to 60M to scale L1 execution capacity. While this change does not require a hard fork (gas limit is a validator-chosen parameter), it requires extensive testing to ensure network stability at higher computational loads and so inclusion of the EIP in the hard fork ensures that this work is prioritized and ongoing.",
