  "laymanDescription": "This adds support for a widely-used cryptographic curve called secp256r1 (also known as P-256) to Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum only supports the secp256k1 curve for signatures, but many devices and systems use secp256r1. This change allows Ethereum to verify signatures from devices like iPhones, Android phones, hardware wallets, and other systems that use this standard curve, making it easier to integrate with existing infrastructure. Note: This EIP supercedes [RIP-7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md).",
