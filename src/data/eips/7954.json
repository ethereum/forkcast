  },
  "benefits": [
    "Allows deploying larger, more complex contracts within a still-conservative maximum size.",
    "Increases initcode limit to 64KiB, enabling deployment of larger contract bytecode.",
    "Existing deployed contracts remain valid and unaffected.",
    "Minimal protocol change: only updates size constants in existing rules."
  ],
  "tradeoffs": [
    "Not backward compatible for contract deployments exceeding previous limits.",
    "May slightly increase denial-of-service risk from larger contract code, though limit remains conservative."
