    "endUsers": {
      "description": "End users keep existing transaction flows; compatible wallets and RPCs abstract the new gas rules, with potential fee reductions on multi-update transactions."
    },
    "appDevs": {
      "description": "Applications performing multiple native ETH transfers or repeated account updates per transaction may see reduced gas usage and can redesign flows to exploit batched writes."
    },
    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "Wallets must update gas estimation logic for new account-write costs; otherwise, overestimation and related attack surfaces from mispriced transactions become possible."
    },
    "toolingInfra": {
      "description": "Node software, RPC services, and monitoring tools must implement updated gas formulas and parameters for account writes, ensuring estimates and analytics reflect the repricing."

    "layer2s": {
      "description": "EVM-compatible layer 2s that follow mainnet gas rules would need to mirror the new account write costs to preserve behavior compatibility."

    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "Consensus participants and node operators must upgrade for the scheduled gas repricing fork and ensure RPC endpoints implement the new estimation behavior."
    },
    "clClients": {
      "description": "Consensus-layer clients primarily integrate standard fork logistics—activation parameters and testing—since gas metering changes occur entirely in execution-layer state transition logic."
    },
    "elClients": {
      "description": "Execution clients must revise gas constants, implement per-transaction tracking of cold versus warm account writes, and integrate the new costing with EIP-2200 and block-level access list logic."

  "benefits": [
    "Reduces gas charged for repeated updates to the same account within a single transaction.",
    "Brings account update costs closer to the actual cost of computing state root changes.",
    "Reduces disparity between multiple native ETH transfers and analogous token transfers in a single transaction.",
    "Avoids unfair gas penalties for future value-transfer opcodes that repeatedly update account balances."
