    "Static control flow can make static analysis and formal verification of EVM code quadratically more efficient.",
    "Static control flow makes linear-time translators of EVM code possible, including one-pass compilers to machine code and RISC-V.",
    "Clients can validate that deployed code cannot execute invalid instructions, jump to invalid locations, or misuse the stack.",
    "Maintains backwards compatibility, enabling a smooth transition.  Tools and developers can take up the new features as they become available."
