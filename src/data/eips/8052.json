  "laymanDescription": "Adds three precompiles for lattice-based signature verification that are safe against Quantum Computer analysis. The scheme splits verification into Hash-to-Point (with NIST SHAKE256 or EVM-friendly Keccak variants) and a core algorithm, enabling both NIST compliance and gas-efficient verification.",
