      "description": "Enables a more precise accounting of efficient compute operations, thus removing an average of 4% loss in block space per transaction from roundig errors."

  "stakeholderImpacts": {
    "endUsers": {
      "description": "No UX or fee changes; gas limits and pricing remain computed with gas_used, so behavior and costs are unchanged."
    },
    "appDevs": {
      "description": "Minimal code changes expected since limits and fees still use gas_used rather than the new milli_gas counter. `GAS` opcode will report in `milli-gas`."

    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "Transaction fee estimation and validation remain tied to gas_used; no API surface changes described or wallet-side modifications expected."
    },
    "toolingInfra": {
      "description": "Tools using gas_used remain accurate; no explicit requirement to expose milli_gas since it is an internal accounting detail."

    "layer2s": {
      "description": "No specific L2 impacts stated; proposal covers internal EVM accounting only, with fees and limits unchanged at transaction interface."

    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "Fee mechanics and limits remain as today; no staking or validator configuration changes are described in this proposal."

      "description": "No consensus-layer changes are described; proposal targets EL metering, and CL client code modifications are not indicated."

    "elClients": {
      "description": "Add a milli_gas counter; meter opcodes in milli_gas; round to gas at transaction end; keep gas_used for limits/fees. Block-level conversion would be a larger change."
