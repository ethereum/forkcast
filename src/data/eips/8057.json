  "laymanDescription": "Ethereum clients already cache recently used state, so touching the same contracts again soon is cheaper in practice. This EIP updates gas costs to reflect that reality: if an account or storage slot was accessed in the last few blocks, the first access in a new transaction costs less gas. Nothing else about how transactions work changes.",
  "stakeholderImpacts": {
    "endUsers": {
      "description": "Some transactions touching recently used contracts or storage may cost less gas, lowering typical fees without changing how users interact."
    },
    "appDevs": {
      "description": "Apps that reuse the same accounts or storage in nearby blocks pay less gas on first access. No opcode changes required."
    },
    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "Wallet gas estimators must include temporal discounts using recent block access lists. Pricing is deterministic from public chain data."
    },
    "toolingInfra": {
      "description": "Builders and searchers may batch related operations across back-to-back blocks to capture discounts. Tooling must report per-call gas using this rule."

    "layer2s": {
      "description": "Rollup bridges and keepers reusing L1 state across nearby blocks pay less gas on first access. Rollup protocol rules remain unchanged."
    },
    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "Validators must upgrade for the fork and maintain a short rolling index of recently accessed items to verify block gas charges."
    },
    "clClients": {
      "description": "Consensus clients mostly just activate the fork and accept payloads using the new gas schedule. No other logic changes."
    },
    "elClients": {
      "description": "Execution-layer clients must implement the new temporal discount logic, track prior-block access lists, and update gas accounting for first accesses."

  "benefits": [
    "Aligns gas costs with real client caching and hardware behavior.",
    "Lowers average per-access gas without increasing worst-case cost.",
    "Improves effective L1 throughput and block execution efficiency.",
    "Enables deterministic, provable pricing from recent block data, easing stateless validation."
