  "title": "Inter-Block Temporal Locality Gas Discounts",
  "status": "Draft",
  "description": "Introduces a deterministic, multi-block discount for the first access to accounts and storage keys in a transaction. The discount decays to zero based on how many blocks have passed since the item was last touched. Intra-block warming is unchanged. The mechanism uses block-level access lists (EIP-7928) from prior blocks so a newly synced node can price the first block it validates without replaying historical execution.",

  "laymanDescription": "Ethereum clients already cache recently used state, so touching the same contracts again soon is cheaper in practice. This EIP updates gas costs to reflect that reality: if an account or storage slot was accessed in the last few blocks, the first access in a new transaction costs less gas. Nothing else about how transactions work changes.",
