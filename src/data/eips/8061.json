  "laymanDescription": "Raises limits on how many validators can activate, exit, or consolidate each epoch and separates consolidation churn, improving validator consolidation speed and easing deposit and exit queues while preserving a long weak-subjectivity period and existing security assumptions.",

      "description": "No direct user-facing changes; effects are limited to validator churn parameters, with only indirect benefits through future finality improvements."

    "Triples the global churn limit while preserving a long weak-subjectivity period for consensus safety.",
    "Increases activation and exit throughput, shortening validator deposit and exit queues under growing stake.",
    "Separates consolidation churn into its own limit, configurable independently from activation and exit churn.",
    "Improves staking liquidity by reducing consolidation time and associated opportunity costs for validators."
