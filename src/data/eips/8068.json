  "description": "This EIP proposes a neutral effective balance design to ensure 0x01 (skimming) and 0x02 (compounding) validators receive equal yields by adjusting hysteresis thresholds, resetting EB after withdrawals, and preventing gaming to support stake consolidation.",

      "description": "No direct effect; staking reward accounting stays inside the consensus layer and user transactions stay unchanged."
