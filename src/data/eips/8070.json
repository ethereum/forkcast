      "description": "No user-facing change; blob transactions stay reliable as BPO forks raise throughput, reducing failures from Execution Layer bandwidth pressure."

    "appDevs": {
      "description": "Application logic unchanged; contracts or rollup sequencers relying on blob data get steadier L1 availability during busy network-wide periods."

    "walletDevs": {
      "description": "Wallets submitting type-3 blob transactions gain more reliable propagation; minimal adjustments, mainly ensuring compatibility with updated EL peers locally."

    "toolingInfra": {
      "description": "Block explorers, relays and monitors should surface partial-blob availability and new eth/71 fields to reflect node sampling state."

      "description": "Rollups posting blobs to L1 face lower risk of EL blobpool saturation, keeping DA publication within expected windows."

    "stakersNodes": {
      "description": "Validator operators must run EL clients supporting sparse blobpool to match CL custody; operational workflows stay largely intact."
    },
    "clClients": {
      "description": "Consensus clients need to send custody updates over Engine API and tolerate EL sampling, adding moderate networking and API work."

      "description": "Execution clients implement eth/71, blobpool sampling, storage for custody cells and builder policies—largest code changes and testing burden."

    "Cuts EL blobpool bandwidth to ~25% of current design.",
    "Keeps CL and EL sampling aligned for DA checks.",
    "Preserves stochastic blobpool without complex sharding.",
